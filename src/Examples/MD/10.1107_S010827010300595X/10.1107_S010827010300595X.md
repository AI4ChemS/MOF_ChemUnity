cations bridged by carboxylate groups from oxydiacetate ligands, is presented. The GdIII cations lie at sites with crystallographic 32 symmetry and display a tricapped trigonalprism arrangement, which is de®ned by six carboxyl and three ether O atoms. The ZnII cations lie at sites with imposed 2/m symmetry and are octahedrally coordinated by four carboxyl O atoms and two apical water ligands, which form strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Comparison is made with the previously reported isostructural homologous copper±gadolinium complex.

## Comment

The design of new compounds with speci®c architectures is a rapidly developing ®eld in modern inorganic chemistry. One successful strategy is based on the use of both the buildingbonding approach and the hydrogen-bonding capability of the ligands (Lehn, 1995). The oxydiacetate anion (oda) is a well known and versatile ligand that is able to chelate and bridge metal ions in a variety of ways, leading to the formation of polynuclear and low-dimensional systems (Grirrane et al., 2002). We have recently reported the study of a series of oxydiacetate-bridged copper(II)±lanthanide(III) threedimensional polymers, formulated as {[Cu3Ln2(oda)6-
(H2O)6]12H2O}n [Ln = Y, Gd, Eu, Nd and Pr (Baggio et al.,
2000); Ln = Dy, Ho, Er and Y (Rizzi et al., 2002)]. These polymers crystallize in the hexagonal system, with space group P6/mcc (No. 192). Replacement of copper by zinc ions to obtain isostructural zinc±lanthanide compounds appears possible, in principle, in spite of the lack of crystal-®eld stabilization of the ZnII cation. Such compounds should be of interest in the study of magnetic exchange interactions between lanthanide ions, since ZnII has no unpaired electrons.

The ®rst Zn±Gd compound bridged by carboxylate groups has been reported for the propionate derivative [Zn2Gd2- (O2CC2H5)8(C9H7N)2(NO3)2(H2O)2] (Cui et al., 2001). The structure consists of two triply propionate-bridged dinuclear Zn±Gd subunits, linked together by two tridentate propionate groups bridging the neighboring GdIII ions. We report here the isolation and X-ray structure of the title compound, (I). The crystallographic results reveal that the Zn±Gd complex is isostructural with the other members of the copper±lanthanide series, in particular the Cu±Gd member, (II).

The structure of (I) consists of two distinct types of building

block, viz. GdO9 and ZnO6, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Two GdO9 and three ZnO6 cores form the unit cell that generates an extended, highly symmetric, three-dimensional structure. The Gd atom lies at the intersection of a three- and a twofold axis and is coordinated by the carboxylate O1 and O10 atoms (where the prime denotes the twofold-related part of the oda ligand) and by the ether O3 atoms of three symmetry-related oda ligands [GdÐOcarboxyl = 2.402 (2) AÊ and GdÐOether = 2.475 (3) AÊ ; Table 1], leading to the usual tricapped trigonalprismatic geometry (TCTP; Albertsson, 1968). The gadoli-

nium coordination polyhedron is similar to that found in (II), to the extent that a superposition of the two entities (XP in SHELXTL; Bruker, 1999) matched within an average deviation of less than 0.045 AÊ .

Each Zn atom lies at the intersection of a twofold axis and a mirror plane, and is coordinated by the outer carboxylate O2 and O20 atoms of four oda ligands [ZnÐObasal = 2.052 (2) AÊ ],
which de®ne the equatorial plane. The apical sites are occupied by two water molecules at a ZnÐO distance of 2.152 (1) AÊ , similar to the basal bonds. The geometries of the GdO9 and ZnO6 coordination polyhedra are unexceptional and their average bonding distances are similar to those obtained in a search for similarly coordinated cores in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD; Allen, 2002); mean GdÐO and ZnÐO distances in the CSD (49 and 125 structures, respectively): 2.45 (8) and 2.10 (7) AÊ ; measured for (I): 2.43 (4) and 2.09 (5) AÊ .

The most noteworthy differences between (I) and (II) are found in the vicinity of the octahedral site, where the nearly isometric coordination of Zn in (I) contrasts with the strong Jahn±Teller distortion around copper in (II) [CuÐ
Obasal = 1.956 (4) AÊ and CuÐOapical = 2.519 (2) AÊ ]. These bond-length differences propagate through the connecting chains, linking the three-dimensional structure in such a way as to modify the cell constants by decreasing a by 1.4% and increasing c by 4.5% when replacing copper with zinc. Therefore, the corresponding ZnZn and GdGd separations have different values along different directions. Distances taken along the two-dimensional structures, nearly parallel to the apical OÐCuÐO bonds ([100], [010] and [110]), shrink, while distances taken normal to the twodimensional structures, almost along the diagonal of the basal coordination plane ([001]), expand when replacing Cu by Zn.

The intramolecular ZnGd separation of 5.753 (1) AÊ ,
however, is very similar to the corresponding CuGd distance in (II) [5.695 (1) AÊ ], because the interatomic vector is nearly parallel to the almost invariant [111] direction.

All the outer carboxylate O atoms link to Zn atoms, so that each Gd atom is surrounded by six Zn atoms as nearest neighbors, while the Zn atoms have four Gd atoms in their vicinity, as expected from the Zn/Gd molar relationship. Through this connectivity pattern, the Gd polyhedra create a two-dimensional planar honeycomb structure, parallel to
(001), at z heights of 14 and 34. Each pair of polyhedra at one side of the hexagonal motif is connected to the homologous pair one layer below (above) via a Zn atom bonded to four outer carboxylate O atoms (two from above and two from below). As a result of the translational symmetry along z, the two-dimensional structure develops into a three-dimensional honeycomb structure with columnar voids with a diameter of almost 6 AÊ (Fig. 2). These, in turn, are occupied by a number of highly disordered water molecules. Their interaction with the main structure could not be studied, since the H atoms of the water molecules were not found. On the other hand, the only independent water H atom in the zinc coordination sphere binds strongly to atom O1 of the ligand, and this H atom was clearly resolved in a difference Fourier map (Table 2).

In spite of the differences in their octahedral sites, the whole array in (I) is very similar to that found in (II), which suggests that ZnII can replace the CuII ions in the octahedral CuO6 sites in the Cu±Ln system, leading to an isomorphous Zn±Ln series. This could be useful in understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of these extended solids.

## Experimental

Chemicals for the synthesis of (I) were used as purchased (reagent grade) without further puri®cation. Zinc acetate dihydrate (0.35 g, 1.5 mmol) and gadolinium acetate hydrate (0.35 g, 1 mmol) were dissolved in an aqueous solution (25 ml) of oxydiacetic acid (0.60 g, 4.5 mmol) and stirred at room temperature for 4 h. After a few weeks, colorless crystals of the compound suitable for X-ray diffraction were ®ltered off and dried in air.

#### Re®Nement

The structure of the homologous copper±gadolinium complex was used as a starting model for re®nement by least squares on F2, using all data, with anisotropic displacement parameters for non-H atoms. H atoms belonging to the coordinated water molecules were found in the ®nal F synthesis and were fully re®ned with isotropic displacement parameters. H atoms attached to C atoms were included in calculated positions and allowed to ride. The water molecules appeared to be very disordered in the columnar cavities of the structure, and it was impossible to determine their overall number by X-ray techniques alone. Thermogravimetric analysis of freshly prepared samples showed a weight loss, m, of 19.6% (expected for 18 water molecules: 19.8%), of which 6.6% corresponds to the six water molecules and the rest (13.0%) corresponds to the remaining water of crystallization This remainder amounts to 11.8 (12) molecules per formula unit; only a fraction of these molecules (75%)
were found in a difference Fourier map and they appeared to be scattered into ®ve independent positions, with a total O-atom occupation of 8.9 (5). These molecules were re®ned with a common isotropic displacement parameter without their H atoms.

Δρmax = 0.78 e Å−3 Δρmin = −0.72 e Å−3 Geometry. All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s. planes.
