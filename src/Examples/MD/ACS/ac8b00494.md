# Triple-Wavelength-Region Luminescence Sensing Based on a Color-Tunable Emitting Lanthanide Metal Organic Framework

Lanthanide metal–organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs), the perfect unity of the porosity of MOFs and the high efficient luminescence of lanthanide ions, have received increasing attention in recent years.By the rational designs of synthesis and measurement routes, Ln-MOFs as the platform can hold up diverse luminescence process for different demands, including the Ln−3+ions tuned ligand-centered emission,columinescence of ligand and Ln−3+ions,as well as the characteristic emission of Ln−3+ions.Therefore, a color-tunable luminescence or white-light emission can be obtained predictably by reasonable modification of the energy transfer process which occurs in the interior of the frameworks.−A mass of color-tunable or white-light materials were designed based on the in-suit doping different Ln,3+ions into the host MOFs or by the postsynthetic modification (PSM) of the frameworks and have performed an extremely important function in areas of lighting and display.However, the applications of the color-tunable or white-light materials in other aspects also need to be urgently developed.−

In the past few years, Ln-MOFs have been frequently employed for the sensing of anions and cations, organic small molecules, or temperature due to their unique photoluminescent properties and high recognition capability for guest molecules.However, the majority of sensing signal responses are based on the monotonous enhancement or quenching of luminescent intensity, which is generally influenced by environmental interference, including the system noise, excitation power fluctuations, light source, etc.−The luminescence-color change (LCC) sensing approach can effectively avoid these drawbacks in comparison with the traditional turn-on/-off sensing.,Recently, some LCC sensors based on lanthanide coordination polymers (LnCPs) have been reported.For example, a white-light-emitting lanthanide coordination polymer that could be effectively applied to the detection of Ag−+and Mn2+ions by way of the LCC process with unique higher selectivity and sensitivity has been reported in our previous work.It represents the first white-light-emitting material at the luminescent sensing territory.Similarly, some mixed-component Ln-MOFs have also been employed as the LCC platform for the realization of ratiometric sensing, e.g., Zaworotko et al. have reported mixed-crystal variants EuTbx1–ZMOF (ZMOF = zeolite metal–organic framework) for the LCC sensing of LPA (lysophosphatidic acid, a biomarker for ovarian cancer and other gynecologic cancers).xAlthough some LCC paths can be realized by exactly adjusting the multiple energy transfer process among the different components, the misty sensing mechanism and simplex sensing property is still a great barrier for the development of this type of sensor.

To the best of our knowledge, multifunctional luminescence sensors based on the LCC process of color tunable material have never been explored.Herein, a triple-wavelength-region sensing procedure was designed and utilized as a trifunctional LCC path for the detection of anions, cations, and organic small molecules.In this system, La3+, Eu3+, and Tb3+ions are three independent luminescence centers, which can perform a synergism effect on the final luminescence color.Along with the change of the energy transfer paths from ligand to metal (LMET) or from Ln3+ions to other Ln3+ions (MMET), the corresponding luminescent color from the sample was changed too.When complex4was excited at 300, 305, and 350 nm, the specific energy transfer mechanism provides a diverse LCC sensing process for HS–ions, THF, and Ag+ions, respectively.Notably, complex4is the first example of a color-tunable emitting material being used for luminescent sensing applications as well as the first multifunctional material that can sense anions, cations, and organic small molecules.

Complex4was synthesized by a room temperature reaction.A mixture of lanthanide nitrate (0.4 mmol; La/Eu/Tb = 0.88:0.02:0.10),H3L (0.4 mmol), DMF (3.5 mL), and H2O (1.5 mL) was added to a round-bottom flask with a magneton and allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 h.The resulting white powder was filtrated and washed with DMF several times.The yield was 70% for4(based on H3L).For complex4, the molar ratios of the different Ln3+ions are mainly identical to that of the mixture of lanthanide nitrate, which were completely demonstrated by ICP, distinctly revealing that in situ doping of the lanthanide ions was successful (Table S1).In addition, the identical structures of complexes1–4are demonstrated by the corresponding PXRD patterns too (Figure S4).

## Luminescence Sensing Experiments

To obtain a stable suspension, the crystal samples of the complex were finely ground and desolved in DMF forming a 0.2 mg/mL suspension by ultrasonication treatment for 30 min.Then the stable suspension was applied for luminescence sensing analyses at room temperature.For the sensing experiments of anions and cations, different anions and cations aqueous solutions (1 × 10–4M) were added to the suspension (2 mL) with the same quantity to examine the potential of complex4to selectively recognize anions and cations.For the sensing of small organic molecules, these SOMs were slowly introduced into the DMF suspension (2 mL).The slit widths of excitation and emission were kept the same all of the time.

## X-ray Crystallographic Analysis

Crystal data for complexes1–3were collected on an Oxford Xcalibur Gemini Ultra diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature.Structures of complexes1–3were solved by using Patterson methods (SHELXS-97), expanded using Fourier methods, and refined using SHELXL-97 (full-matrix least-squares on F2) and WinGX v1.70.01 programs packages.All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.Empirical absorption corrections based on equivalent reflections were applied.For complexes1–3, the contribution of highly disordered anions/solvent molecules were treated as diffuse using the SQUEEZE procedure implemented in the PLATON program.The resulting new files were applied to further refine the structures.The SQUEEZE results are consistent with TG and elemental analysis, which indicates that there are half of the DMF and one water molecule in a structure unit as free guest.These solvent molecules are added in the molecular formula.The crystal data and structure refinements of complexes1–3are summarized inTable.Crystallographic data for complexes1–3have been deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center with CCDC nos.1818054-1818056.

## Results and Discussion

## Crystal Structure Analysis of Complexes1–3

X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals complexes1–3are isostructural with aC2/cspace group.In a typical structure of complex1, each asymmetric unit consists of one crystallographically independent La3+ion, one deprotonated dcbba ligand, and two coordinated DMF molecules (Figure S5a).Each La3+ion is nine-coordinated by seven oxygen atoms from carboxyls of five H3dcbba ligends and two oxygen atoms from two DMF molecules (Figure S5b).Meanwhile, the neighboring La3+ions were bridged through oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups of branched organic ligand and further form the [La2(COO)6]secondary building unit (SBUs;nFigurea).The neighboring dinuclear [La2(COO)6]units were connected by Ln3–in (k1-k1-μ2)-(k1-k1-μ1)-μ3mode forming a 1D chain (Figurec).The adjacent 1D chains were linked by the isophthalic sections of ligand L3–in (k1-k2-μ3) mode forming a 2D network (Figured).The adjacent 2D networks further accumulation into 3D frameworks in the vertical direction (Figuree).Notably, the framework exhibits an open 1D window with the size of about 9.8 × 9.5 Å2(opposite distance of O7 to O7 and C14 to C14).PLATON calculation shows that there is about 18.7% accessible volume of the unit cell volume when the guest molecules were removed.From a topological point of view, the dcbba ligand bridge three carboxylate groups can be considered as a 3-connected node, and the dinuclear [La2(COO)6]SBUs connected by six carboxylate groups can be considered as a 6-connected node.nAs a result, the framework can be viewed as a (3,6)-connected 3D topology, and the structure of complex1can be simplified as a new topology with the topological point symbol of {42·6}2{44·62·87·102} calculated with TOPOS.

## Luminescence Properties of Complexes1–3

The solid-state 3D luminescent spectra of free ligand and complexes1–3were conducted at room temperature.As shown inFigure, the dcbba ligand exhibited strong blue-green emission with the broad emission band from 400 to 500 nm when excited at 300–380 nm.Similarly, complex1exhibits Ln3+ions tuned ligand-centered emission around 400–550 nm upon being excited at 300–380 nm.However, the emission intensity exhibited an obvious enhancement with the increasing excitation wavelength.On the contrary, complex2completely exhibits a characteristic emission of Eu3+ions at 593, 616, 650, and 699 nm, respectively, which corresponds to the5D0→7F(JJ= 1–4) transitions of the Eu3+ion upon being excited at 300–380 nm.The lifetime and quantum yield for complex2are τ = 1.25 ms (Ex = 368 nm) and Φ = 28.36%(Figure S6b).Similarly, complex3exhibits four peaks at 490, 544, 582, and 621 nm corresponding to the5D4→7FJ(J= 6–3) transitions of the Tb3+ion (Figurea).The quantum yield and lifetime are 1.28 ms and 25.11%, respectively (Figure S6c).The long luminescence lifetimes and high quantum yields of complexes2and3suggest that the energy transfer between the H3dcbba ligand and lanthanide ions is effective (Table S2).

## Color-Tunable Luminescence and White-Light

To design novel multiple-waveband response luminescent material and explore the multifunctional luminescent sensing application, primarily, an excitation wavelength sensitive color tunable luminescent sample should be afforded.For the coordination system of the metal–organic ligand, the most direct and efficient path is the in-suit doping of the trichromatic.Considering that complexes−1–3are isostructural and exhibit pure blue, red, and green emission, respectively, the color-tunable and white-light emission sample would be possible via the multiple and synergetic energy transfer between ligand and metal (LMET) or between different lanthanide metal ions (MMET).In fact, an excitation wavelength-dependent color-tunable luminescent complex4has been realized by the doping of La3+, Eu3+, and Tb3+ions into the host frameworks, and the PXRD measure exhibiting the framework structure of complex4is isostructural with complexes1–3.As shown inFigure, when excited at 300 nm, an orange emission can be observed with CIE coordinates of (0.442, 0.439).Since the emission spectra of complex1exhibit the broad emission around at 400–550 nm, it is should be pointed out that when the codoping complex4was excited at 300 nm there was not an obvious broad LC emission observed in the emission spectra of complex4, but the sharp emission peak at 544 nm still remained and, with a stronger intensity, seems to indicate that the emission peak at 544 nm should be attributed to characteristic transitions of Tb3+ions rather than La3+ions.With the excitation wavelength increase, the emission intensity of the blue component augments gradually and the characteristic emissions of Eu3+and Tb3+ions were decreased continually.Thus, a white emission with CIE coordinates of (0.330, 0.339) was observed when excited at 305 nm.When varying the excitation wavelength to 350 nm, the blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.202, 0.173) from ligand becomes dominated.Obviously, a smooth process of tunable colors from orange to white to blue has been obtained by the adjustment of the excitation wavelength, implying that complex4is a possible candidate as multifunctional luminescent sensing materials.

## Triple-Waveband Response Luminescent Sensing

Complex4shows a fluent luminescence-color change (LCC) process when the excitation wavelength varies from 300 to 350 nm.It inspires a series of novel ideas for LCC luminescent sensing: (1) the boring luminescence enhancement or quenching can be replaced by LCC so that the interference from the environment can be avoided; (2) the design of different LCC processes may meet new potential application for color-tunable luminescence materials; (3) multifunctional luminescent sensing materials will possibly be fabricated based on the multiple LCC processes.Therefore, the LCC sensing processes were studied with the excitation toward 300 nm (orange), 305 nm (white), and 350 nm (blue), respectively.

First, the selective tests toward the anion were analyzed when the suspension of complex4(0.2 mg/mL) was excited at 300 nm.The emission spectra of the suspension containing variable anion aqueous solutions of NaX (X = POx43–, Br–, ClO4–, SO32–, I–, HCO3–, CO32–, NO2–, CrO42–, MoO42–, SiO32–, HSO3–, F–, and HS–,x= 1–3) were recorded.The ratios of the5D4→7F5transition intensities of Tb3+ions (I544) and5D0→7F2transition intensities of Eu3+ions (I616) were applied to evaluate the LCC process.As shown inFigureandTable S3, the luminescence spectra of the blank sample and the majority of anion ions@complex4remain almost the same in terms of the ratios ofI544/I616being about 1.However, the luminescence spectra of HS–@complex4show obvious LCC phenomenon compared to other X@complexx–4systems with the ratios ofI544/I616closing to 1.4, exhibiting obvious LCC from orange to green.The sensing properties of complex4to HS–ions were further investigated by the quantitative fluorescence titration experiments.According toFigureb, the intensity ofI544showed negligible change when the content of HS–ions was increased gradually.However, the intensity ofI616shown evidently decreases, exhibiting obvious LCC phenomenon from orange to blue.The excellent selectivity and visible LCC phenomenon boost the potential application on detecting HS–ions via the LCC process.

Second, the suspension of complex4shows a white-light emission with CIE coordinates of (0.330, 0.339) upon the excitation at 305 nm.To further investigate the LCC sensing ability of complex4excited 305 nm, it was employed for the sensing of small organic molecules (SOMs).As shown inFigure, the THF@complex4exhibits a distinct LCC process compared with other SOMs.The concentration dependence analysis shows that the luminescent intensities ofI544(green) andI616(red) gradually decrease and the intensity of the ligand-center (blue) evidently increases with increasing THF content, which results in a LCC process from white to violet.Notably, the LCC phenomenon can be observed easily even when the content of THF is lower than 20 μL, further confirming that complex4can acts as a highly selective and sensitive LCC sensor for THF.To the best of our knowledge, complex4is the first example of a luminescent sensor for THF based on Ln-MOFs.

Third, the blue emission from the ligand becomes dominated when complex4was excited at 350 nm.Based on the previously reports, several transition metal ions can be used as the sensitizer for lanthanide ions emission, which result in a more excellent energy transfer from ligands to Ln3+ions.In other words, the weak characteristic emission for complex−4excited at 350 nm will be possibly restored when certain transition metal ions were introduced into the suspension system, and a LCC process will be inspired finally.To confirm this hypothesis, various metal cation aqueous solutions of X­(NO3)(100 μM, X = Znx2+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Al3+, Hg2+, Na+, Mg2+, NH4+, Ba2+, K+, Cr3+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Ag+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Cu2+,x= 1–3) have been added into the suspension of complex4.As shown inFigurea, the LCC features for X@complexx+4depend largely on the nature of the metal cations.Several familiar quenchers, such as Fe3+, Co2+, and Cu2+ions, exhibit drastic quenching effects, which have been frequently reported previously.In contrast, the luminescent color of Ag+@complex4exhibits obvious LCC from blue to green.This result implies that complex4can be used as a sensor to selectively detect Ag+ions by the LCC process when complex4was excited at 350 nm.The sensing properties of complex4toward Ag+ions were further carried out by monitoring a series of emissions of complex4with gradually increased Ag+ions concentration excited at 350 nm.With the increasing concentration of Ag+ions, remarkably, the ligand-center emission of complex4was continuously quenched.However, the intensity of characteristic emission for Tb3+ions was restored.It should be noticed that there is not evident enhancement on the characteristic emission for Eu3+ions, which might be attributed to the fact that the energy transfer process from Tb3+to Eu3+was interrupted because of the existence of Ag+ions.

In addition, the stability and recyclability of the complex4LCC sensing has been conducted through recycling experiments.Upon the suspension of complex4, it was centrifuged, filtered, and washed several times with DMF.The relative intensity between LC emission,I544andI616, in the emission spectra of the regenerative suspension was almost invariable even after being used for four repeated cycles (Figure S12–14).The corresponding PXRD patterns support that the crystal structures remained after the recycling experiments.(Figure S11)

The mechanism of the LCC sensing of complex4was proposed according to the experiments.First, the PXRD patterns of complex4before and after luminescent sensing HS–ions, THF, and Ag+ions were still identical with that of the simulated pattern, implying that the luminescence color change did not stem from the breakdown of the host framework (Figure S11).Therefore, the LCC phenomenon of complex4can possibly be attributed to the following reasons: certain ions may form the weak interactions with the benzene rings of ligand, such as the hydrogen bonds or π interactions; the competed photon absorption might exist between analytes and ligand; and the efficiency of intersystem crossing of S1 to T1 is likely to be promoted due to the unique properties of analytes, such as the heavy-atom effect of Ag+ions.In order to confirm these hypotheses, some necessary experiments were carried out.

Complex4was conducted by the in-suit doping of La3+, Eu3+, and Tb3+ions with a molar ratio of La0.88/Eu0.02/Tb0.10.Although the contents of the Tb3+ions is almost five times that of the Eu3+ions, the characteristic peaks of Eu3+ions at 616 nm were stronger than those of Tb3+ions at 544 nm when complex4was excited at 300 nm, which can be attributed to an energy transfer from Tb3+to Eu3+ions (Scheme S1).Although the La,,3+ions contributed a main content with 88% in complex4, the La3+ions are unable for transferring the energy to the Eu3+ions due to the fact that there is no energy transfer between ligand and La3+ions.With the gradual increase of HS–ions, the intensity ofI544shows negligible change, but the intensity ofI616shows an evident decrease, indicated that the energy transfer process from Tb3+to Eu3+ions was disturbed continuously.We easily speculate that there are weak interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) existing between HS,–ions and the other sections of frameworks.It may further break the energy transfer from Tb3+to Eu3+ions, which results in the decreasing emission of Eu3+ions (Figure).In order to verify these hypotheses, the energy transfer process located in the single-lanthanide MOF and the mixed sample of Eu-MOF and Tb-MOF (molar ratio was 1:5) were investigated (Figure S8).In the single phase and mixed phase systems, there are almost no changes for the luminescence intensity of Tb3+and Eu3+ions observed, implying that the weak interactions between HS–ions and the framework did not effect energy transfer efficiency from ligand to Ln3+ions.Thus the energy transfer from Tb3+to Eu3+ions is not going to happen in this mixed system too.So we can summarize that the energy transfer from Tb3+to Eu3+ions can be produced in the intra framework only.Therefore, the in-suit doping complex4can be an ideal sensor for the sensing of HS–ions.

For the LCC sensing when complex4was excited at 305 and 350 nm, some underlying mechanisms were raised.For the sensing of THF, the ligands-center emission evidently increases and the characteristic of Ln3+ions gradually decreases, indicating the antenna affect was weakened.In contrast, the luminescence spectra of complex4toward Ag+ions show that the antenna affect was amplified with the increasing Ag+ions concentration.To further testify to the underlying mechanism, the luminescence emission peaks analyses for THF@complex4and Ag+@complex4toward various concentrations were carried out (Figures S9 and S10andTables S4 and S5).With the presence of THF, the ligand-center emission produced a blue shift, implying an increase in the energy level of the π* energy of the ligand, leading to a disturbance in the energy transfer from the π* orbits to the lanthanide ions, which results in the ligand-center emission dominating the emission spectra and the LCC from white to violet.On the contrary, a red shift of the ligand-center emission would be introduced when Ag+ions were added into the suspension of complex4, suggesting an enhance in the π* orbits of the ligand.The more becomingly match between the π* orbits of the ligand and the resonance energy level of the Ln3+ions will boost up the more highly efficiency energy transfer from the ligand to the Ln3+ions.Therefore, in the presence of Ag+ions, complex4exhibited stronger characteristic emissions of Ln3+ions and weaker ligand-center emission, which leads to a LCC process from blue to green (Scheme).,

Although some other analytes may also form an interaction with the framework or affect the energy level of the ligand, the properties difference of these analytes, such as the electronic absorption/donation ability, the electronegativity, the polarity, the absorbance of the solvent, etc., will affect the final luminescence emission results.In a word, the physical and chemical properties of the framework and analytes produce a synergistic effect on the luminescence performance of the complex.Therefore, the dominating factors were discussed in more detail in this work.

## Conclusions

Reactions of H3dcbba and Ln­(NO3)3·6H2O afford a series of isostructural lanthanide metal–organic frameworks1–3.The identical structures of complexes1–3provides a chance to afford isomorphic mixed La/Eu/Tb-dcbba (4) via the in-suit doping of different Ln3+ions into the host framework.Based on the regulation of the energy transfer efficiency from ligand to metal, a novel and multifunctional sensing process was designed, which can detect HS–ions, THF, and Ag+ions via different LCC processes.The remarkable color change, excellent selectivity, and high sensitivity verify that this type of color-tunable luminescence material can be a promising sensor for anions, cations, or organic small molecules.To the best of our knowledge, complex4is the first multifunctional material that can sense anions, cations, and organic small molecules.This approach may provide potential multifunctional materials for luminescent sensing application.
