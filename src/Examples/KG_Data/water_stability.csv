0,[HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6]<|>compound 1,NAVCAO,Water Stability,Not provided,N/A,,"The document does not provide explicit information about the water stability of [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] or compound 1. The text discusses the synthesis, crystallographic data, and thermal analysis, but does not mention the compound's behavior in water or aqueous solutions. Therefore, the water stability is categorized as 'Not provided'.",10.1039/a700472i
1,[Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>complex 2,FEKDAA,Water Stability,Not provided,N/A,,"The document does not provide specific information regarding the water stability of [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] or complex 2. There is no mention of its behavior in water or aqueous solutions, nor any details about its crystallinity or structural changes upon exposure to moisture or water.",10.1039/a804945i
2,C9H12CaO10<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,OWZEW01,Water Stability,Not provided,N/A,,"The document does not provide specific information regarding the water stability of the MOF C9H12CaO10 or calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction. There is no mention of its solubility, retention of porous structure, crystallinity, or changes in properties after exposure to moisture or water. The document focuses on synthesis methods, structural analysis, and other properties but does not address water stability directly.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
