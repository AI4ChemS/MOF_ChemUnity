3,C23.5H28.5EuN2.5O10.5<|>complex 2,CIJBEF,Luminescent sensing,Investigated,"Lanthanide metalâ€“organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs), the perfect unity of the porosity of MOFs and the high efficient luminescence of lanthanide ions, have received increasing attention in recent years. By the rational designs of synthesis and measurement routes, Ln-MOFs as the platform can hold up diverse luminescence process for different demands... In the past few years, Ln-MOFs have been frequently employed for the sensing of anions and cations, organic small molecules, or temperature due to their unique photoluminescent properties and high recognition capability for guest molecules.",10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00494
