2,C9H12CaO10<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,OWZEW01,Hydrogen storage,Investigated,"Experimental hydrogen storage capacity of calcium trimesate was found to be 0.066% in one-pot self-assembly reaction and 0.045% in ion exchange method by mass. While the complex structure synthesized by the ion exchange method differs from that of the complex synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction, the hydrogen storage capacities show similar behavior as the hydrogen storage spaces is closed by hydrogen bonds.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
