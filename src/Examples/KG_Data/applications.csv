0,[HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6]<|>compound 1,NAVCAO,Not Provided,Not Provided,The document does not mention any specific applications for the MOF [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] or compound 1.,10.1039/a700472i
1,[Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>complex 2,FEKDAA,Not Provided,Not Provided,The document does not mention any specific application for [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] or complex 2.,10.1039/a804945i
2,C9H12CaO10<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,OWZEW01,Hydrogen storage,Investigated,"Experimental hydrogen storage capacity of calcium trimesate was found to be 0.066% in one-pot self-assembly reaction and 0.045% in ion exchange method by mass. While the complex structure synthesized by the ion exchange method differs from that of the complex synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction, the hydrogen storage capacities show similar behavior as the hydrogen storage spaces is closed by hydrogen bonds.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
3,C23.5H28.5EuN2.5O10.5<|>complex 2,CIJBEF,Luminescent sensing,Investigated,"For the LCC sensing when complex4was excited at 305 and 350 nm, some underlying mechanisms were raised. For the sensing of THF, the ligands-center emission evidently increases and the characteristic of Ln3+ions gradually decreases, indicating the antenna affect was weakened. In contrast, the luminescence spectra of complex4toward Ag+ions show that the antenna affect was amplified with the increasing Ag+ions concentration.",10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00494
4,C23.5H28.5TbN2.5O10.5<|>complex 3,CIJBIJ,"Luminescent sensing of anions, cations, and organic small molecules",Investigated,"In the past few years, Ln-MOFs have been frequently employed for the sensing of anions and cations, organic small molecules, or temperature due to their unique photoluminescent properties and high recognition capability for guest molecules.",10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00494
