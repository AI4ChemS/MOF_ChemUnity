[HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6]<|>compound 1,NAVCAO,"The compound [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] matches the CSD Ref Code NAVCAO based on several key features. The metal node is iron (Fe), which matches the 'Metal Nodes' in NAVCAO. The space group is P3¯c1, which corresponds to the 'Space Group' in NAVCAO. The lattice parameters a = 13.5274 Å and c = 19.2645 Å are consistent with those provided for NAVCAO. Additionally, the chemical composition and structure described in the document align with the molecular formula Fe16O112P28, which is consistent with the CSD entry. The organic linker, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, is also mentioned in the chemical name of NAVCAO.",10.1039/a700472i
[Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>Complex 2,FEKDAA,"The compound [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] is described in the document as a 1-D linear coordination polymer with silver (Ag) as the metal node. The space group is P1, and the molecular formula is consistent with Ag1C15F3H14N2O3S9. These details match the CSD Reference Code FEKDAA, which also lists Ag as the metal node, the same space group, and a matching molecular formula. The chemical name provided in the CSD reference code also aligns with the description of the compound in the document.",10.1039/a804945i
C9H12CaO10<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,OWZEW01,"The MOF C9H12CaO10 matches the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01 based on several key features. The metal node is calcium (Ca), which matches the metal node in the CSD reference. The space group is P21/c, which is the same as the one provided in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a, b, and c are 10.1977 Å, 16.4581 Å, and 7.4796 Å, respectively, which match the parameters given in the CSD reference. Additionally, the molecular formula C9H12CaO10 is consistent with the description of the calcium trimesate synthesized by the one-pot self-assembly reaction in the document. These matching features confirm that this MOF corresponds to the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
