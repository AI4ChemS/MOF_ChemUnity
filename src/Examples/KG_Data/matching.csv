[HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6]<|>compound 1,NAVCAO,"The compound [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] matches the CSD Ref Code NAVCAO based on several key features. The metal node is iron (Fe), which matches the 'Fe' metal node in the CSD reference. The space group is P3¯c1, which matches the space group 'P-3c1' in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a = 13.5274 Å and c = 19.2645 Å are consistent with the CSD reference. Additionally, the chemical composition and structure described in the document align with the molecular formula 'Fe16O112P28' provided in the CSD reference. The organic linker, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, is also consistent with the chemical name provided in the CSD reference.",10.1039/a700472i
[Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>complex 2,FEKDAA,"The MOF [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] matches the CSD Ref Code FEKDAA based on several key features. The metal node is Ag, which matches the 'Ag' in the CSD reference. The molecular formula provided in the text is C15H14AgF3N2O3S9, which matches the molecular formula in the CSD reference. Additionally, the space group for complex 2 is P1, which is consistent with the space group provided in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a, b, and c in the text (7.946, 11.202, 7.707) also match those in the CSD reference. These consistent features confirm that [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] corresponds to the CSD Ref Code FEKDAA.",10.1039/a804945i
C9H12CaO10<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,OWZEW01,"The MOF C9H12CaO10 matches the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01 based on several key features. The metal node is calcium (Ca), which matches the metal node in the CSD reference. The space group is P21/c, which is the same as the one provided in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a, b, and c are 10.1977, 16.4581, and 7.4796 Å, respectively, which match the parameters given in the CSD reference. Additionally, the chemical composition aligns with the molecular formula C36Ca4H48O40 when considering the stoichiometry of the trimesate ligand and water molecules. These consistent features confirm the match with the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
C23.5H28.5EuN2.5O10.5<|>complex 2,CIJBEF,"The MOF with the empirical formula C23.5H28.5EuN2.5O10.5 matches the CSD Ref Code CIJBEF. The space group is C2/c, which matches the space group provided in the CSD reference. The metal node is Eu, which is consistent with the metal node in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a, b, and c (28.220, 14.540, 13.394) are also consistent with those provided in the CSD reference. Therefore, this MOF is identified as CIJBEF.",10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00494
