[HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6]<|>compound 1,NAVCAO,"The compound [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] matches the CSD Ref Code NAVCAO based on several key features. The space group is P3¯c1, which matches the space group provided for NAVCAO. The metal node is iron (Fe), consistent with the metal node in NAVCAO. The lattice parameters a = 13.5274 Å and c = 19.2645 Å are identical to those listed for NAVCAO. Additionally, the chemical composition and structure described in the document align with the molecular formula Fe16O112P28 provided for NAVCAO. These consistent features confirm the match.",10.1039/a700472i
[Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>complex 2,FEKDAA,"The MOF [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] matches the CSD Ref Code FEKDAA based on several key features. The metal node is Ag, which matches the 'Ag' in the CSD reference. The space group for complex 2 is 'P1', which is the same as the space group provided in the CSD reference. The molecular formula 'Ag1C15F3H14N2O3S9' matches the one given in the CSD reference. Additionally, the lattice parameters a = 7.946, b = 11.202, and c = 7.707 are consistent with those provided in the CSD reference. These consistent features confirm that [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] corresponds to the CSD Ref Code FEKDAA.",10.1039/a804945i
C9H12CaO10<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,OWZEW01,"The MOF C9H12CaO10 matches the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01 based on several key parameters. The metal node is calcium (Ca), which matches the metal node in the CSD reference. The space group is P21/c, which is identical to the space group provided in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a, b, and c are 10.1977 Å, 16.4581 Å, and 7.4796 Å, respectively, which match the dimensions given in the CSD reference. Additionally, the chemical composition aligns with the molecular formula C36Ca4H48O40 when considering the stoichiometry of the trimesate ligand and water molecules. These factors collectively justify the assignment of the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01 to this MOF.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
