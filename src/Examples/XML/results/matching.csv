C9H12CaO10<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,OWZEW01,"The MOF C9H12CaO10 matches the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01 based on several parameters. The metal node is calcium (Ca), which matches the metal node in the CSD reference. The space group is P21/c, which is the same as in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a, b, and c are 10.1977 Å, 16.4581 Å, and 7.4796 Å, respectively, which match the CSD reference. Additionally, the chemical name ""catena-((μ-hydrogen benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate)-tetra-aqua-calcium)"" corresponds to the description of the calcium trimesate complex. The molecular formula C9H12CaO10 is consistent with the CSD reference's molecular formula C36Ca4H48O40 when considering the stoichiometry and coordination environment described in the document.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
C23.5H28.5EuN2.5O10.5<|>complex 2,CIJBEF,"The MOF with the empirical formula C23.5H28.5EuN2.5O10.5 is referred to as complex 2 in the document. It has a monoclinic crystal system with a space group of C2/c, which matches the space group provided for CSD Code CIJBEF. The metal node is Europium (Eu), which is consistent with the metal node in the CSD Code CIJBEF. The lattice parameters a, b, and c (28.220 Å, 14.540 Å, and 13.394 Å, respectively) also match those provided for CIJBEF. Therefore, complex 2 corresponds to the CSD Ref Code CIJBEF.",10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00494
C23.5H28.5TbN2.5O10.5<|>complex 3,CIJBIJ,"The MOF with the empirical formula C23.5H28.5TbN2.5O10.5 is referred to as complex 3 in the document. It has a monoclinic crystal system with a space group of C2/c, which matches the space group provided for CSD Code CIJBIJ. The metal node is Terbium (Tb), which is consistent with the metal node in the CSD Code CIJBIJ. The lattice parameters a, b, and c (28.614 Å, 14.383 Å, and 13.644 Å, respectively) also match those provided for CIJBIJ. Therefore, complex 3 corresponds to the CSD Ref Code CIJBIJ.",10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00494
