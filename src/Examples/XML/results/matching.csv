C9H12CaO10<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,OWZEW01,"The MOF C9H12CaO10 matches the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01 based on several key parameters. The metal node is calcium (Ca), which matches the metal node in the CSD reference. The space group is P21/c, which is identical to the space group provided in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a, b, and c are 10.1977 Å, 16.4581 Å, and 7.4796 Å, respectively, which match the dimensions given in the CSD reference. Additionally, the chemical composition aligns with the molecular formula C36Ca4H48O40 when considering the stoichiometry of the trimesate ligand and water molecules. These factors collectively justify the assignment of the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01 to this MOF.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
C18H30Ca3O24<|>calcium trimesate synthesized by ion exchange method,not provided,"The MOF C18H30Ca3O24 does not match the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01. Although the metal node is calcium, the space group is C2/c, which does not match the P21/c space group in the CSD reference. Additionally, the molecular formula and lattice parameters do not align with those provided in the CSD reference. Therefore, this MOF does not correspond to the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
C9H14MgO11·H2O<|>magnesium trimesate synthesized by one-pot self-assembly reaction,not provided,"The MOF C9H14MgO11·H2O does not match the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01. The metal node is magnesium (Mg), whereas the CSD reference specifies calcium (Ca) as the metal node. Additionally, the space group is P21/c, but the molecular formula and metal node do not align with the CSD reference. Therefore, this MOF does not correspond to the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
C18H34Mg3O26·4H2O<|>magnesium trimesate synthesized by ion exchange method,not provided,"The MOF C18H34Mg3O26·4H2O does not match the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01. The metal node is magnesium (Mg), whereas the CSD reference specifies calcium (Ca) as the metal node. Additionally, the space group is P-1, which does not match the P21/c space group in the CSD reference. Therefore, this MOF does not correspond to the CSD Ref Code OWEZEW01.",10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.11.128
C23.5H28.5EuN2.5O10.5<|>complex 2,CIJBEF,"The MOF with the empirical formula C23.5H28.5EuN2.5O10.5 matches the CSD Ref Code CIJBEF. The space group is C2/c, which matches the space group provided in the CSD Ref Code. The metal node is Eu, which is consistent with the metal node in the CSD Ref Code. The lattice parameters a, b, and c (28.220, 14.540, 13.394) are also consistent with those provided in the CSD Ref Code CIJBEF.",10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00494
C23.5H28.5TbN2.5O10.5<|>complex 3,CIJBIJ,"The MOF with the empirical formula C23.5H28.5TbN2.5O10.5 matches the CSD Ref Code CIJBIJ. The space group is C2/c, which matches the space group provided in the CSD Ref Code. The metal node is Tb, which is consistent with the metal node in the CSD Ref Code. The lattice parameters a, b, and c (28.614, 14.383, 13.644) are also consistent with those provided in the CSD Ref Code CIJBIJ.",10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00494
