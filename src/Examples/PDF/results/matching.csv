[HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6]<|>compound 1,NAVCAO,"The compound [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] matches the CSD Ref Code NAVCAO based on several key features. The metal node is iron (Fe), which matches the 'Fe' metal node in NAVCAO. The space group is P3¯c1, which matches the space group 'P-3c1' in NAVCAO. The lattice parameters a = 13.5274 Å and c = 19.2645 Å are consistent with those provided for NAVCAO. Additionally, the chemical composition and structure described in the document align with the molecular formula 'Fe16O112P28' and the chemical name provided for NAVCAO. Therefore, this compound is identified as the MOF with the CSD Ref Code NAVCAO.",10.1039/a700472i
[Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>complex 2,FEKDAA,"The compound [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] is described in the document as a 1-D linear coordination polymer with silver (Ag) as the metal node. The molecular formula provided in the document is consistent with the CSD reference code FEKDAA, which lists the molecular formula as Ag1C15F3H14N2O3S9. Additionally, the space group for this compound is P1, which matches the space group provided in the CSD reference code. The lattice parameters a, b, and c are also consistent with those given in the CSD reference code. Therefore, the compound [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>complex 2 matches the CSD reference code FEKDAA.",10.1039/a804945i
