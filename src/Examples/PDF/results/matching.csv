[HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6]<|>compound 1,NAVCAO,"The compound [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] matches the CSD Ref Code NAVCAO based on several key features. The space group is P3¯c1, which matches the space group provided for NAVCAO. The metal node is iron (Fe), consistent with the metal node in NAVCAO. The lattice parameters a = 13.5274 Å and c = 19.2645 Å are identical to those listed for NAVCAO. Additionally, the chemical composition and structure described in the document align with the molecular formula Fe16O112P28 provided for NAVCAO. These consistent features confirm the match.",10.1039/a700472i
[Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>complex 2,FEKDAA,"The MOF [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] matches the CSD Ref Code FEKDAA based on several key features. The metal node is Ag, which matches the 'Ag' in the CSD reference. The space group for complex 2 is 'P1', which is the same as the space group provided in the CSD reference. The molecular formula 'Ag1C15F3H14N2O3S9' matches the one given in the CSD reference. Additionally, the lattice parameters a = 7.946, b = 11.202, and c = 7.707 are consistent with those provided in the CSD reference. These consistent features confirm that [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] corresponds to the CSD Ref Code FEKDAA.",10.1039/a804945i
