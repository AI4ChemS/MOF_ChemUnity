[HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6]<|>compound 1,NAVCAO,"The compound [HN(CH2CH2)3NH]3[Fe8(HPO4)12(PO4)2(H2O)6] matches the CSD Ref Code NAVCAO based on several key features. The metal node is iron (Fe), which matches the 'Fe' metal node in the CSD reference. The space group is P3¯c1, which matches the space group 'P-3c1' in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a = 13.5274 Å and c = 19.2645 Å are consistent with the CSD reference. Additionally, the chemical composition and structure described in the document align with the molecular formula 'Fe16O112P28' provided in the CSD reference. The organic linker, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, is also consistent with the chemical name provided in the CSD reference.",10.1039/a700472i
[Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)]<|>complex 2,FEKDAA,"The MOF [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] matches the CSD Ref Code FEKDAA based on several key features. The metal node is Ag, which matches the 'Ag' in the CSD reference. The molecular formula provided in the text is C15H14AgF3N2O3S9, which matches the molecular formula in the CSD reference. Additionally, the space group for complex 2 is P1, which is consistent with the space group provided in the CSD reference. The lattice parameters a, b, and c in the text (7.946, 11.202, 7.707) also match those in the CSD reference. These consistent features confirm that [Ag(CM-TTF)(CF3SO3)] corresponds to the CSD Ref Code FEKDAA.",10.1039/a804945i
