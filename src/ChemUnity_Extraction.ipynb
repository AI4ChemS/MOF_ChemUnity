    "\n",
    "This notebook is a demonstration on how the property extraction workflow in MOF-ChemUnity is done. Prior to running this, the MOF names that are extracted from the Matching Workflow are required, so we advise the user to run ``ChemUnity_Matching.ipynb`` first to retrieve these. Furthermore, the vector stores generated from the Matching Workflow can be re-used here - there is no need to read .pdf, .xml or convert files to .md."
