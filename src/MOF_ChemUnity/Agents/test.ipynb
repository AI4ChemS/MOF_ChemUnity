    "You are an expert chemist. The document describes the synthesis and characterization of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Coordinated Polymers (CPs) with crystal structures and other properties. MOFs or CPs are compound with very well-defined crystalline structure that consist of a transition metal node like Cu, Dy, Zn, etc. and an organic linker that is commonly referred to with short hand names like DME, or BTC. Use your chemistry knowledge to determine whether a compound is a metal, organic linker or a MOF.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1) Compound names: MOFs and CPs can have different based on the author. They can be code names like: 'ZIF-8, HKUST-1, etc.' or Chemical formulas: 'Cu2(btc)3, etc.' Make sure to extract one of these formats after resolving any co-references such as 'Compound 1, 1a, crystal 1, network 1a, etc'. When outputting the final MOF name, concatenate the all co-references to the single MOF with \"<|>\". For Example, \"Cu2(Btc)3 - HKUST-1, or compound 1, is a very good MOF\". Should output a MOF name of \"Cu2(BTC)3<|>HKUST-1<|>compound 1\". The MOF names you are extracting MUST BE UNQIUE!\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Make sure to fully unpack MOF generic formulas into the individual MOFs names. For example \"X-DMF.2H2O (X = Cu, Zn, Mn)\" should output MOFs 'Cu-DMF.2H2O', 'Zn-DMF.2H2O', 'Mn-DMF.2H2O'. Often you can encounter co-references their as well. For example, \"Cu2(DMF)4.3(S) (S = iba (Cu-iba), ina (Cu-ina))\" should output the following individual MOFs: 'Cu2(DMF)4.3(iba)<|>Cu-iba' and 'Cu2(DMF)4.3(ina)<|>Cu-ina'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Justification: Always provide a justification for your output. The justification must be logical and should help the user understand how you went about answering their question. Never make up answers without justification from provided information. You can use chemistry knowledge to deduce Metal Nodes and Organic Linkers and chemical formula stoichiometry only!\n",

Introduction\\n\\nFor natural gas purification CO2 and light hydrocarbons are removed from methane in order to reduce CO2-induced pipeline corrosion and produce high-purity gases for energy and other industrial applications.1 The purified methane obtained from natural gas is an alternative to gasoline or diesel automobile fuels.2 Furthermore, natural gas is the main source of ethane, which is the second largest component after methane, ranging from 0.7 to 6.8 volume percent.3 Ethane is the main feedstock for ethylene production, which in turn serves as the primary building block of polyethylene-based materials.4 Thus effective separation of light hydrocarbon gases (C1-C2) is important for the petroleum industry and influences the price and availability of plastics, used routinely in our daily lives. Currently CO2 and light hydrocarbon fractions of natural gas are separated through energy intensive cryogenic distillation; separation using solid state adsorbents capable of operating in higher temperatures is proposed as a more economical alternative.5 Indeed several classes of porous solid state materials have been tested for industrially important gaseous hydrocarbon separation (e.g. C2, C3, C4) with encouraging results.6-8 Zeolites 5A and 13X can be used for the propylene/propane separation as reported by Järvelin and Fair.6 Linear and branched hydrocarbon mixtures such as nbutane/i-butane or xylene isomers can be separated with MFItype zeolites, with the reported separation factor between 20- 60 for n-butane and over 600 for xylene.7 Silver exchanged porous aromatic framework PAF-1-SO3H effectively separates C2 hydrocarbons, as reported by Ma and coworkers.8 Microporous MOFs, formed by metal atoms or atom clusters connected by organic ligands to form infinite networks, have sorption properties comparable or superior to benchmark solid state adsorbents.9-13 MOFs possess seemingly limitless structural diversity, high flexibility, and in some cases easily modified frameworks that allow tuning for specific functions.14,15 Possible industrial applications of MOFs include gas storage, gaseous and molecular separation, catalysis or chemical sensing.10,16-23 Selected MOF-based solid state adsorbents are utilized for various hydrocarbon separations.5 For example, ZIF-7 and RPM-3-Zn [ZIF: Zeolitic Imidazole Framework, Zn(phim)2; phim: benzimidazole, RPM: Rutgers Porous Material; Zn2(bpdc)2(bpee); bpdc: 4,4'- biphenyldicarboxylate, bpee: 1,2-bipyriylethylene] can separate C2-C4 hydrocarbons, due to the gate opening effect, happening at different pressures for smaller and larger molecules.24,25 MOF-5 [Zn4O(bdc)3] separates methane from n-butane, and linear from branched alkanes.26,27 HKUST-1 [HKUST: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Cu3(btc)2; btc: 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate] separates o-, mand p-xylenes.28 Experimental gas adsorption studies of MOFs usually focus on gas isotherms measurments that, while providing the necessary information on the overall gas uptake and framework behavior upon gas loading, yield limited information on gas adsorption mechanism. Understanding the key atom-atom interactions responsible for high gas selectivity provides a means to discriminate between possible materials for industrial applications like natural gas purification.

The low toxicity and Earth abundance of Ca- and Mg-based MOFs, relative to first-row transitional metals or lanthanide metals-based MOF analogues, may be especially beneficial in potential industrial applications.37-39 We have recently reported several calcium MOFs with interesting properties.40-43 Herein, we report hydrocarbon adsorption mechanism determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction on two calcium-based MOFs - SBMOF-1 [Ca(sdb); sdb: 4,4'-sulfonyldibenzoate] and a novel material SBMOF-2 [Ca(tcpb); tcpb: 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4carboxyphenyl)benzene]. Their C2/C1 selectivity was determined from the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations, supported by transient breakthrough calculations.44,45 Since the examples related to the C2Hn-framework interaction determined by single crystal diffraction method are scarce, the detailed structural insights gained here will help design further gas-selective solids of this type.\\n\\nSBMOF-1 is a porous metal organic framework, with moderate surface area of 145 m2/g and calculated porosity of 16% (PLATON).40,46 After removal of solvent water SBMOF-1 does not adsorb water from the air and remains crystalline after exposure to 75% relative humidity for at least 2 months of storage and (Fig. S1).

The sequence of breakthroughs in Figure 5a indicates that SBMOF-1 has the potential of separating methane from C2 hydrocarbon mixtures. Figure 5b depicts the corresponding transient breakthrough simulations for separation of C1/C2 mixtures using SBMOF-2. SBMOF-2 has significantly higher uptake capacities for hydrocarbons as compared to SBMOF-1 (Figures 2a, 2b); consequently the breakthrough times with SBMOF-2 are significantly higher than the corresponding breakthrough times with SBMOF-1. Longer breakthrough times are desirable because this implies longer cycle times before the bed has to be regenerated. We therefore conclude that SBMOF-2 has superior separation performance for C1/C2 separations as compared to SBMOF-1. Finally, we studied how SBMOF-2 performs in separating C1-nC4 7components mixtures. He et al. previously demonstrated the capability of M-MOF-74 for adsorptive \"fractionation\" of a C1/C2/C3 hydrocarbon mixture.62 We now established a similar fractionation capability of SBMOF-2.

Two calcium-based MOFs, designated as SBMOF-1 and SBMOF2 (SB: Stony Brook), form three-dimensional frameworks with one-dimensional open channels. As determined form single crystal diffraction experiments channel geometries of both SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 provide multiple adsorption sites for hydrocarbon molecules trough C-H…π and C-H…O interactions, similarly to interactions in the molecular and protein crystals. Both materials selectively adsorb C2 hydrocarbon gases over methane as determined with IAST and breakthrough calculations as well as experimental breakthrough measurements, with C2H6/CH4 selectivity as high as 74 in SBMOF-1.*\\n\\n1.

Refined occupancies of the adsorbed gases are in the average within less than 10% from the values obtained with gas-adsorption experiments, confirming the validity of the technique (Table S5). Main presumed adsorbate-host interactions in SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 are the C-H····π and C-H…O, with the latter appearing only in the channels of the type II in SBMOF-2. Such interactions play a significant role in the molecular crystals packing, protein folding and molecular recognition. 59,61,63 Analysis of the structural data of SBMOF-1:C2Hn collected at 100 K revealed that upon the loading with C2Hn, sdb linkers rotated back to a parallel configuration observed in the assynthesized material. Adsorbates locate on the inversion center at the center of the pore. In each structure half of the C2Hn molecule is within the asymmetric unit and the second half is generated by the symmetry operation. Distances between hydrogen atoms of the C2Hn molecules and neighboring phenyl ring centroids are within 3.07(4) - 3.36(4) Å (Fig. 7). The distance between adsorbate molecules along the channel is equivalent to a lattice parameter b: 5.556(1) Å. The parallel orientation of the linkers provides the optimal geometry for the hydrocarbon molecules, forming cages of four phenyl rings. The ethylene molecule is oriented so that each of the H atoms is pointing towards the closest phenyl ring with the average distance of 3.15(9) Å. Ethane and acetylene gases locate in a similar fashion, with the average C-H…π distances of 3.4(1) and 3.23(8) Å, respectively.

Both materials are selective towards C2Hn hydrocarbons over methane with the maximum C2/C1 selectivity of 74 for C2H6/CH4 in SBMOF-1. The breakthrough simulation data confirmed that both SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 can separate C1/C2 mixtures. SBMOF-2 also has the ability to separate a 7- component CH4/C2H2/C2H4/C2H6/C3H6/C3H8/C4H10 mixture into four different fractions, with increasing carbon numbers.\\n\\nCrystal structure of the gas-loaded SBMOF-1 shows that the framework behaves like a trap towards the C2 hydrocarbons. The pore geometry in SBMOF-1 is optimal for the small C2Hn molecules, as each of the pore segments is built with four phenyl rings, providing strong adsorption sites through C-H...π interactions. SBMOF-2 contains two types of channels, in the first type only phenyl rings are accessible as adsorption sites for hydrocarbon molecules, while the second type contains multiple O atoms in the close proximity to the center of the pore. The adsorbate-adsorbent interaction in SBMOF-2 appears to be similar to the SBMOF-1 case, except in those channels where additional polarizing -OH groups and oxygen atoms serve as strong adsorption sites for C2Hn, through the CH …O interaction. Those single crystal data are confirmed by the experimental gas adsorption and the XRD-DSC studies. In situ XRD-DSC results further suggest that SBMOF-2 displays some network flexibility, which allows accommodation of all the C1-nC4 hydrocarbon gases inside the pore space.\\n\\nAssociated Content\\n\\nSupporting Information.

The calculated C2/C1 selectivity in SBMOF-2 are 26, for C2H6/CH4, 16 for C2H4/CH4 and 18 for C2H2/CH4 (Fig. 2d), also lower than those calculated for SBMOF-1 and FeMOF-74.29 As in SBMOF-1 the only presumed interaction between gas molecules and the pore space is C-H…π, it is expected that the Qst values will decrease with the C-C bond saturation.58,59 However, the Qst values of all three gases are quite similar to each other with the values of 34.8(3), 35.0(5) and 36.3(7) kJ/molGAS for acetylene, ethyelene and ethane, respectively, suggesting that there is no significant influence of the C-C double or triple bond on the adsorbent-adsorbate interaction.\\n\\nIn SBMOF-2 Qst of all C2Hn display also similar values, with 30.3(2), 29.2(1) and 32.3(1) kJ/molGAS for ethane, ethylene and acetylene, respectively. In both materials however, we can see that ethane interacts with the pore surface with the highest energy of the three, in spite of the full saturation of the C-C bond, normally leading to the lower adsorbent-adsorbate energy.\\n\\n58 The C2Hn Qst values for adsorption both on SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 suggest that the size of the molecule and the number of the H-pore surface interactions play a more important role on the resultant energy of adsorption than the saturation of the C-C bond.\\n\\nSBMOF-2 was further tested for the adsorption of heavier C3-nC4 hydrocarbon gases. When looking on the gas adsorption of C1-nC4 alkanes on SBMOF-2, depicted on Figure 3a, we note that the adsorption follows the general trends observed for porous MOFs such as MOF-5.27,60 SBMOF-2 saturates with longer alkanes at lower pressures, and the heavier gas generally displays a lower capacity than the lighter counterpart. Qst becomes higher with an increase in the chain length due to the enhanced electrostatic and dispersion interactions between the adsorbed gases and the pore surfaces (Fig. 3b).61 In mixtures longer chains are preferred over the smaller ones until the point of the maximum selectivity, when the entropic cost of the long chain ordering affects the energy gained from the adsorption.5 The separation performance of industrial fixed bed adsorbents is dictated by a combination of adsorption selectivity and uptake capacity. In order to demonstrate the potential of SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 for separation of hydrocarbon mixtures, we performed transient breakthrough simulations. The results for separation of equimolar 4-component CH4/C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixture using SBMOF-1 at 298 K, with partial pressures of 25 kPa each are presented on Figure 5a.')],\n",

The document describes the synthesis and characterization of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Coordinated Polymers (CPs) with crystal structures and other properties. MOFs or CPs are compound with very well-defined crystalline structure that consist of a transition metal node like Cu, Dy, Zn, etc. and an organic linker that is commonly referred to with short hand names like DME, or BTC. Use your chemistry knowledge to determine whether a compound is a metal, organic linker or a MOF.\\n\\n## Instructions:\\n1) Compound names: MOFs and CPs can have different based on the author. They can be code names like: \\'ZIF-8, HKUST-1, etc.\\' or Chemical formulas: \\'Cu2(btc)3, etc.\\' Make sure to extract one of these formats after resolving any co-references such as \\'Compound 1, 1a, crystal 1, network 1a, etc\\'. When outputting the final MOF name, concatenate the all co-references to the single MOF with \"<|>\". For Example, \"Cu2(Btc)3 - HKUST-1, or compound 1, is a very good MOF\". Should output a MOF name of \"Cu2(BTC)3<|>HKUST-1<|>compound 1\". The MOF names you are extracting MUST BE UNQIUE!\\n\\n2) Make sure to fully unpack MOF generic formulas into the individual MOFs names. For example \"X-DMF.2H2O (X = Cu, Zn, Mn)\" should output MOFs \\'Cu-DMF.2H2O\\', \\'Zn-DMF.2H2O\\', \\'Mn-DMF.2H2O\\'. Often you can encounter co-references their as well. For example, \"Cu2(DMF)4.3(S) (S = iba (Cu-iba), ina (Cu-ina))\" should output the following individual MOFs: \\'Cu2(DMF)4.3(iba)<|>Cu-iba\\' and \\'Cu2(DMF)4.3(ina)<|>Cu-ina\\'.\\n\\n3) Justification: Always provide a justification for your output. The justification must be logical and should help the user understand how you went about answering their question. Never make up answers without justification from provided information. You can use chemistry knowledge to deduce Metal Nodes and Organic Linkers and chemical formula stoichiometry only!\\n\\n4) Always include the following in the output: DOI, MOF Name from text, CSD Reference Code (if Provided).

Introduction\\n\\nFor natural gas purification CO2 and light hydrocarbons are removed from methane in order to reduce CO2-induced pipeline corrosion and produce high-purity gases for energy and other industrial applications.1 The purified methane obtained from natural gas is an alternative to gasoline or diesel automobile fuels.2 Furthermore, natural gas is the main source of ethane, which is the second largest component after methane, ranging from 0.7 to 6.8 volume percent.3 Ethane is the main feedstock for ethylene production, which in turn serves as the primary building block of polyethylene-based materials.4 Thus effective separation of light hydrocarbon gases (C1-C2) is important for the petroleum industry and influences the price and availability of plastics, used routinely in our daily lives. Currently CO2 and light hydrocarbon fractions of natural gas are separated through energy intensive cryogenic distillation; separation using solid state adsorbents capable of operating in higher temperatures is proposed as a more economical alternative.5 Indeed several classes of porous solid state materials have been tested for industrially important gaseous hydrocarbon separation (e.g. C2, C3, C4) with encouraging results.6-8 Zeolites 5A and 13X can be used for the propylene/propane separation as reported by Järvelin and Fair.6 Linear and branched hydrocarbon mixtures such as nbutane/i-butane or xylene isomers can be separated with MFItype zeolites, with the reported separation factor between 20- 60 for n-butane and over 600 for xylene.7 Silver exchanged porous aromatic framework PAF-1-SO3H effectively separates C2 hydrocarbons, as reported by Ma and coworkers.8 Microporous MOFs, formed by metal atoms or atom clusters connected by organic ligands to form infinite networks, have sorption properties comparable or superior to benchmark solid state adsorbents.9-13 MOFs possess seemingly limitless structural diversity, high flexibility, and in some cases easily modified frameworks that allow tuning for specific functions.14,15 Possible industrial applications of MOFs include gas storage, gaseous and molecular separation, catalysis or chemical sensing.10,16-23 Selected MOF-based solid state adsorbents are utilized for various hydrocarbon separations.5 For example, ZIF-7 and RPM-3-Zn [ZIF: Zeolitic Imidazole Framework, Zn(phim)2; phim: benzimidazole, RPM: Rutgers Porous Material; Zn2(bpdc)2(bpee); bpdc: 4,4'- biphenyldicarboxylate, bpee: 1,2-bipyriylethylene] can separate C2-C4 hydrocarbons, due to the gate opening effect, happening at different pressures for smaller and larger molecules.24,25 MOF-5 [Zn4O(bdc)3] separates methane from n-butane, and linear from branched alkanes.26,27 HKUST-1 [HKUST: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Cu3(btc)2; btc: 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate] separates o-, mand p-xylenes.28 Experimental gas adsorption studies of MOFs usually focus on gas isotherms measurments that, while providing the necessary information on the overall gas uptake and framework behavior upon gas loading, yield limited information on gas adsorption mechanism.

The low toxicity and Earth abundance of Ca- and Mg-based MOFs, relative to first-row transitional metals or lanthanide metals-based MOF analogues, may be especially beneficial in potential industrial applications.37-39 We have recently reported several calcium MOFs with interesting properties.40-43 Herein, we report hydrocarbon adsorption mechanism determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction on two calcium-based MOFs - SBMOF-1 [Ca(sdb); sdb: 4,4'-sulfonyldibenzoate] and a novel material SBMOF-2 [Ca(tcpb); tcpb: 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4carboxyphenyl)benzene]. Their C2/C1 selectivity was determined from the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations, supported by transient breakthrough calculations.44,45 Since the examples related to the C2Hn-framework interaction determined by single crystal diffraction method are scarce, the detailed structural insights gained here will help design further gas-selective solids of this type.\\n\\nSBMOF-1 is a porous metal organic framework, with moderate surface area of 145 m2/g and calculated porosity of 16% (PLATON).40,46 After removal of solvent water SBMOF-1 does not adsorb water from the air and remains crystalline after exposure to 75% relative humidity for at least 2 months of storage and (Fig. S1). Structurally SBMOF-1 is composed of Ca metal centers, coordinated by oxygen atoms in octahedral configuration and v-shaped sdb organic linkers, forming diamond-shaped 1-D channels along b direction (Fig. 1). After removal of solvent water, the framework of SBMOF-1 undergoes a structural rearrangement involving the rotation of the sdb linker.40 Our previous study showed that SBMOF-1 is Figure 1.

The sequence of breakthroughs in Figure 5a indicates that SBMOF-1 has the potential of separating methane from C2 hydrocarbon mixtures. Figure 5b depicts the corresponding transient breakthrough simulations for separation of C1/C2 mixtures using SBMOF-2. SBMOF-2 has significantly higher uptake capacities for hydrocarbons as compared to SBMOF-1 (Figures 2a, 2b); consequently the breakthrough times with SBMOF-2 are significantly higher than the corresponding breakthrough times with SBMOF-1. Longer breakthrough times are desirable because this implies longer cycle times before the bed has to be regenerated. We therefore conclude that SBMOF-2 has superior separation performance for C1/C2 separations as compared to SBMOF-1. Finally, we studied how SBMOF-2 performs in separating C1-nC4 7components mixtures. He et al. previously demonstrated the capability of M-MOF-74 for adsorptive \"fractionation\" of a C1/C2/C3 hydrocarbon mixture.62 We now established a similar fractionation capability of SBMOF-2. The breakthrough simulation data in Figure 5c demonstrate that SBMOF-2 has the ability to separate a 7-component CH4/C2H2/C2H4/C2H6/C3H6/C3H8/C4H10 mixture into four different fractions, with increasing carbon numbers.

Two calcium-based MOFs, designated as SBMOF-1 and SBMOF2 (SB: Stony Brook), form three-dimensional frameworks with one-dimensional open channels. As determined form single crystal diffraction experiments channel geometries of both SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 provide multiple adsorption sites for hydrocarbon molecules trough C-H…π and C-H…O interactions, similarly to interactions in the molecular and protein crystals. Both materials selectively adsorb C2 hydrocarbon gases over methane as determined with IAST and breakthrough calculations as well as experimental breakthrough measurements, with C2H6/CH4 selectivity as high as 74 in SBMOF-1.*\\n\\n1.

Refined occupancies of the adsorbed gases are in the average within less than 10% from the values obtained with gas-adsorption experiments, confirming the validity of the technique (Table S5). Main presumed adsorbate-host interactions in SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 are the C-H····π and C-H…O, with the latter appearing only in the channels of the type II in SBMOF-2. Such interactions play a significant role in the molecular crystals packing, protein folding and molecular recognition. 59,61,63 Analysis of the structural data of SBMOF-1:C2Hn collected at 100 K revealed that upon the loading with C2Hn, sdb linkers rotated back to a parallel configuration observed in the assynthesized material. Adsorbates locate on the inversion center at the center of the pore. In each structure half of the C2Hn molecule is within the asymmetric unit and the second half is generated by the symmetry operation. Distances between hydrogen atoms of the C2Hn molecules and neighboring phenyl ring centroids are within 3.07(4) - 3.36(4) Å (Fig. 7). The distance between adsorbate molecules along the channel is equivalent to a lattice parameter b: 5.556(1) Å. The parallel orientation of the linkers provides the optimal geometry for the hydrocarbon molecules, forming cages of four phenyl rings. The ethylene molecule is oriented so that each of the H atoms is pointing towards the closest phenyl ring with the average distance of 3.15(9) Å. Ethane and acetylene gases locate in a similar fashion, with the average C-H…π distances of 3.4(1) and 3.23(8) Å, respectively. Acetylene and ethylene molecules display a two-fold disorder while ethane shows no spatial disorder.\\n\\nIn SBMOF-2 gas adsorption sites differ between channels of type I and II. In the type I channels, the only presumed interactions are between hydrogen atoms of adsorbates and π clouds of organic linkers. The adsorbates locate within less than 4 Å distance to two or four phenyl rings at a time. The shortest CH …π lengths, measured as a distance between the H atom and the phenyl centroid, are 3.11(2), 3.09(2) and 3.10(2) Å for acetylene, ethylene and ethane, respectively (Fig. 7).

Both materials are selective towards C2Hn hydrocarbons over methane with the maximum C2/C1 selectivity of 74 for C2H6/CH4 in SBMOF-1. The breakthrough simulation data confirmed that both SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 can separate C1/C2 mixtures. SBMOF-2 also has the ability to separate a 7- component CH4/C2H2/C2H4/C2H6/C3H6/C3H8/C4H10 mixture into four different fractions, with increasing carbon numbers.\\n\\nCrystal structure of the gas-loaded SBMOF-1 shows that the framework behaves like a trap towards the C2 hydrocarbons. The pore geometry in SBMOF-1 is optimal for the small C2Hn molecules, as each of the pore segments is built with four phenyl rings, providing strong adsorption sites through C-H...π interactions. SBMOF-2 contains two types of channels, in the first type only phenyl rings are accessible as adsorption sites for hydrocarbon molecules, while the second type contains multiple O atoms in the close proximity to the center of the pore. The adsorbate-adsorbent interaction in SBMOF-2 appears to be similar to the SBMOF-1 case, except in those channels where additional polarizing -OH groups and oxygen atoms serve as strong adsorption sites for C2Hn, through the CH …O interaction. Those single crystal data are confirmed by the experimental gas adsorption and the XRD-DSC studies. In situ XRD-DSC results further suggest that SBMOF-2 displays some network flexibility, which allows accommodation of all the C1-nC4 hydrocarbon gases inside the pore space.\\n\\nAssociated Content\\n\\nSupporting Information.

The C2H4/CH4 and C2H2/CH4 selectivity for SBMOF-1 are lower than those of the Fe-MOF-74 (700 and 200, respectively),29 because of the presence of open metal sites in the activated framework in the latter case, while SBMOF-1 possesses no open metal sites.\\n\\nHowever, the 74 C2H6/CH4 selectivity is more than 3 times higher than for Fe-MOF-74 (20).29 SBMOF-2 uptake of C2Hn is more than 2 times higher than in the case of SBMOF-1 at 298 K and 1 bar, and the difference in maximum uptake between methane and C2Hn is more prominent than for SBMOF-1. SBMOF-2 adsorbs 17.3 cm3/g of methane at 298 K and 64.7, 59.8 and 62.2 cm3/g of acetylene, ethylene and ethane, respectively (Fig. 2b). The maximum uptake of C2Hn in SBMOF-2 at 1 bar, 298K is lower than for prototypical MOFs such as Fe-MOF-74, or MOF-5 but considerably higher than those of other porous materials extensively studied for hydrocarbon adsorption like ZIF-8 or RPM3-Zn.4,24,25,57 Qst values for C1-C2 hydrocarbons adsorbed on SBMOF-2 are lower than in the case of the SBMOF-1 material (Table 1). The calculated C2/C1 selectivity in SBMOF-2 are 26, for C2H6/CH4, 16 for C2H4/CH4 and 18 for C2H2/CH4 (Fig. 2d), also lower than those calculated for SBMOF-1 and FeMOF-74.29 As in SBMOF-1 the only presumed interaction between gas molecules and the pore space is C-H…π, it is expected that the Qst values will decrease with the C-C bond saturation.58,59 However, the Qst values of all three gases are quite similar to each other with the values of 34.8(3), 35.0(5) and 36.3(7) kJ/molGAS for acetylene, ethyelene and ethane, respectively, suggesting that there is no significant influence of the C-C double or triple bond on the adsorbent-adsorbate interaction.\\n\\nIn SBMOF-2 Qst of all C2Hn display also similar values, with 30.3(2), 29.2(1) and 32.3(1) kJ/molGAS for ethane, ethylene and acetylene, respectively. In both materials however, we can see that ethane interacts with the pore surface with the highest energy of the three, in spite of the full saturation of the C-C bond, normally leading to the lower adsorbent-adsorbate energy.\\n\\n58 The C2Hn Qst values for adsorption both on SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 suggest that the size of the molecule and the number of the H-pore surface interactions play a more important role on the resultant energy of adsorption than the saturation of the C-C bond.\\n\\nSBMOF-2 was further tested for the adsorption of heavier C3-nC4 hydrocarbon gases. When looking on the gas adsorption of C1-nC4 alkanes on SBMOF-2, depicted on Figure 3a, we note that the adsorption follows the general trends observed for porous MOFs such as MOF-5.27,60 SBMOF-2 saturates with longer alkanes at lower pressures, and the heavier gas generally displays a lower capacity than the lighter counterpart. Qst becomes higher with an increase in the chain length due to the enhanced electrostatic and dispersion interactions between the adsorbed gases and the pore surfaces (Fig. 3b).61 In mixtures longer chains are preferred over the smaller ones until the point of the maximum selectivity, when the entropic cost of the long chain ordering affects the energy gained from the adsorption.5 The separation performance of industrial fixed bed adsorbents is dictated by a combination of adsorption selectivity and uptake capacity. In order to demonstrate the potential of SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 for separation of hydrocarbon mixtures, we performed transient breakthrough simulations. The results for separation of equimolar 4-component CH4/C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixture using SBMOF-1 at 298 K, with partial pressures of 25 kPa each are presented on Figure 5a.')]"

The document describes the synthesis and characterization of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Coordinated Polymers (CPs) with crystal structures and other properties. MOFs or CPs are compound with very well-defined crystalline structure that consist of a transition metal node like Cu, Dy, Zn, etc. and an organic linker that is commonly referred to with short hand names like DME, or BTC. Use your chemistry knowledge to determine whether a compound is a metal, organic linker or a MOF.\\n\\n## Instructions:\\n1) Compound names: MOFs and CPs can have different based on the author. They can be code names like: \\'ZIF-8, HKUST-1, etc.\\' or Chemical formulas: \\'Cu2(btc)3, etc.\\' Make sure to extract one of these formats after resolving any co-references such as \\'Compound 1, 1a, crystal 1, network 1a, etc\\'. When outputting the final MOF name, concatenate the all co-references to the single MOF with \"<|>\". For Example, \"Cu2(Btc)3 - HKUST-1, or compound 1, is a very good MOF\". Should output a MOF name of \"Cu2(BTC)3<|>HKUST-1<|>compound 1\". The MOF names you are extracting MUST BE UNQIUE!\\n\\n2) Make sure to fully unpack MOF generic formulas into the individual MOFs names. For example \"X-DMF.2H2O (X = Cu, Zn, Mn)\" should output MOFs \\'Cu-DMF.2H2O\\', \\'Zn-DMF.2H2O\\', \\'Mn-DMF.2H2O\\'. Often you can encounter co-references their as well. For example, \"Cu2(DMF)4.3(S) (S = iba (Cu-iba), ina (Cu-ina))\" should output the following individual MOFs: \\'Cu2(DMF)4.3(iba)<|>Cu-iba\\' and \\'Cu2(DMF)4.3(ina)<|>Cu-ina\\'.\\n\\n3) Justification: Always provide a justification for your output. The justification must be logical and should help the user understand how you went about answering their question. Never make up answers without justification from provided information.

Introduction\\n\\nFor natural gas purification CO2 and light hydrocarbons are removed from methane in order to reduce CO2-induced pipeline corrosion and produce high-purity gases for energy and other industrial applications.1 The purified methane obtained from natural gas is an alternative to gasoline or diesel automobile fuels.2 Furthermore, natural gas is the main source of ethane, which is the second largest component after methane, ranging from 0.7 to 6.8 volume percent.3 Ethane is the main feedstock for ethylene production, which in turn serves as the primary building block of polyethylene-based materials.4 Thus effective separation of light hydrocarbon gases (C1-C2) is important for the petroleum industry and influences the price and availability of plastics, used routinely in our daily lives. Currently CO2 and light hydrocarbon fractions of natural gas are separated through energy intensive cryogenic distillation; separation using solid state adsorbents capable of operating in higher temperatures is proposed as a more economical alternative.5 Indeed several classes of porous solid state materials have been tested for industrially important gaseous hydrocarbon separation (e.g. C2, C3, C4) with encouraging results.6-8 Zeolites 5A and 13X can be used for the propylene/propane separation as reported by Järvelin and Fair.6 Linear and branched hydrocarbon mixtures such as nbutane/i-butane or xylene isomers can be separated with MFItype zeolites, with the reported separation factor between 20- 60 for n-butane and over 600 for xylene.7 Silver exchanged porous aromatic framework PAF-1-SO3H effectively separates C2 hydrocarbons, as reported by Ma and coworkers.8 Microporous MOFs, formed by metal atoms or atom clusters connected by organic ligands to form infinite networks, have sorption properties comparable or superior to benchmark solid state adsorbents.9-13 MOFs possess seemingly limitless structural diversity, high flexibility, and in some cases easily modified frameworks that allow tuning for specific functions.14,15 Possible industrial applications of MOFs include gas storage, gaseous and molecular separation, catalysis or chemical sensing.10,16-23 Selected MOF-based solid state adsorbents are utilized for various hydrocarbon separations.5 For example, ZIF-7 and RPM-3-Zn [ZIF: Zeolitic Imidazole Framework, Zn(phim)2; phim: benzimidazole, RPM: Rutgers Porous Material; Zn2(bpdc)2(bpee); bpdc: 4,4'- biphenyldicarboxylate, bpee: 1,2-bipyriylethylene] can separate C2-C4 hydrocarbons, due to the gate opening effect, happening at different pressures for smaller and larger molecules.24,25 MOF-5 [Zn4O(bdc)3] separates methane from n-butane, and linear from branched alkanes.26,27 HKUST-1 [HKUST: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Cu3(btc)2; btc: 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate] separates o-, mand p-xylenes.28 Experimental gas adsorption studies of MOFs usually focus on gas isotherms measurments that, while providing the necessary information on the overall gas uptake and framework behavior upon gas loading, yield limited information on gas adsorption mechanism. Understanding the key atom-atom interactions responsible for high gas selectivity provides a means to discriminate between possible materials for industrial applications like natural gas purification.

The low toxicity and Earth abundance of Ca- and Mg-based MOFs, relative to first-row transitional metals or lanthanide metals-based MOF analogues, may be especially beneficial in potential industrial applications.37-39 We have recently reported several calcium MOFs with interesting properties.40-43 Herein, we report hydrocarbon adsorption mechanism determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction on two calcium-based MOFs - SBMOF-1 [Ca(sdb); sdb: 4,4'-sulfonyldibenzoate] and a novel material SBMOF-2 [Ca(tcpb); tcpb: 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4carboxyphenyl)benzene]. Their C2/C1 selectivity was determined from the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) calculations, supported by transient breakthrough calculations.44,45 Since the examples related to the C2Hn-framework interaction determined by single crystal diffraction method are scarce, the detailed structural insights gained here will help design further gas-selective solids of this type.\\n\\nSBMOF-1 is a porous metal organic framework, with moderate surface area of 145 m2/g and calculated porosity of 16% (PLATON).40,46 After removal of solvent water SBMOF-1 does not adsorb water from the air and remains crystalline after exposure to 75% relative humidity for at least 2 months of storage and (Fig. S1). Structurally SBMOF-1 is composed of Ca metal centers, coordinated by oxygen atoms in octahedral configuration and v-shaped sdb organic linkers, forming diamond-shaped 1-D channels along b direction (Fig. 1). After removal of solvent water, the framework of SBMOF-1 undergoes a structural rearrangement involving the rotation of the sdb linker.40 Our previous study showed that SBMOF-1 is Figure 1.

The sequence of breakthroughs in Figure 5a indicates that SBMOF-1 has the potential of separating methane from C2 hydrocarbon mixtures. Figure 5b depicts the corresponding transient breakthrough simulations for separation of C1/C2 mixtures using SBMOF-2. SBMOF-2 has significantly higher uptake capacities for hydrocarbons as compared to SBMOF-1 (Figures 2a, 2b); consequently the breakthrough times with SBMOF-2 are significantly higher than the corresponding breakthrough times with SBMOF-1. Longer breakthrough times are desirable because this implies longer cycle times before the bed has to be regenerated. We therefore conclude that SBMOF-2 has superior separation performance for C1/C2 separations as compared to SBMOF-1. Finally, we studied how SBMOF-2 performs in separating C1-nC4 7components mixtures. He et al. previously demonstrated the capability of M-MOF-74 for adsorptive \"fractionation\" of a C1/C2/C3 hydrocarbon mixture.62 We now established a similar fractionation capability of SBMOF-2. The breakthrough simulation data in Figure 5c demonstrate that SBMOF-2 has the ability to separate a 7-component CH4/C2H2/C2H4/C2H6/C3H6/C3H8/C4H10 mixture into four different fractions, with increasing carbon numbers.

Two calcium-based MOFs, designated as SBMOF-1 and SBMOF2 (SB: Stony Brook), form three-dimensional frameworks with one-dimensional open channels. As determined form single crystal diffraction experiments channel geometries of both SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 provide multiple adsorption sites for hydrocarbon molecules trough C-H…π and C-H…O interactions, similarly to interactions in the molecular and protein crystals. Both materials selectively adsorb C2 hydrocarbon gases over methane as determined with IAST and breakthrough calculations as well as experimental breakthrough measurements, with C2H6/CH4 selectivity as high as 74 in SBMOF-1.*\\n\\n1.

Refined occupancies of the adsorbed gases are in the average within less than 10% from the values obtained with gas-adsorption experiments, confirming the validity of the technique (Table S5). Main presumed adsorbate-host interactions in SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 are the C-H····π and C-H…O, with the latter appearing only in the channels of the type II in SBMOF-2. Such interactions play a significant role in the molecular crystals packing, protein folding and molecular recognition. 59,61,63 Analysis of the structural data of SBMOF-1:C2Hn collected at 100 K revealed that upon the loading with C2Hn, sdb linkers rotated back to a parallel configuration observed in the assynthesized material. Adsorbates locate on the inversion center at the center of the pore. In each structure half of the C2Hn molecule is within the asymmetric unit and the second half is generated by the symmetry operation. Distances between hydrogen atoms of the C2Hn molecules and neighboring phenyl ring centroids are within 3.07(4) - 3.36(4) Å (Fig. 7). The distance between adsorbate molecules along the channel is equivalent to a lattice parameter b: 5.556(1) Å. The parallel orientation of the linkers provides the optimal geometry for the hydrocarbon molecules, forming cages of four phenyl rings. The ethylene molecule is oriented so that each of the H atoms is pointing towards the closest phenyl ring with the average distance of 3.15(9) Å. Ethane and acetylene gases locate in a similar fashion, with the average C-H…π distances of 3.4(1) and 3.23(8) Å, respectively. Acetylene and ethylene molecules display a two-fold disorder while ethane shows no spatial disorder.\\n\\nIn SBMOF-2 gas adsorption sites differ between channels of type I and II. In the type I channels, the only presumed interactions are between hydrogen atoms of adsorbates and π clouds of organic linkers. The adsorbates locate within less than 4 Å distance to two or four phenyl rings at a time. The shortest CH …π lengths, measured as a distance between the H atom and the phenyl centroid, are 3.11(2), 3.09(2) and 3.10(2) Å for acetylene, ethylene and ethane, respectively (Fig. 7).

In the type II channels pore surface is decorated with multiple oxygen atoms including the -OH groups within the 4 Å from the center of the pore, and provides strong adsorption sites for the adsorbates through the presumed C-H…O interaction (Fig. 7).

S29 - S32).\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nWe characterized adsorption mechanisms of ethane, ethylene and acetylene in two microporous Ca-based metal organic frameworks, SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2. Both materials are selective towards C2Hn hydrocarbons over methane with the maximum C2/C1 selectivity of 74 for C2H6/CH4 in SBMOF-1. The breakthrough simulation data confirmed that both SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 can separate C1/C2 mixtures. SBMOF-2 also has the ability to separate a 7- component CH4/C2H2/C2H4/C2H6/C3H6/C3H8/C4H10 mixture into four different fractions, with increasing carbon numbers.\\n\\nCrystal structure of the gas-loaded SBMOF-1 shows that the framework behaves like a trap towards the C2 hydrocarbons. The pore geometry in SBMOF-1 is optimal for the small C2Hn molecules, as each of the pore segments is built with four phenyl rings, providing strong adsorption sites through C-H...π interactions. SBMOF-2 contains two types of channels, in the first type only phenyl rings are accessible as adsorption sites for hydrocarbon molecules, while the second type contains multiple O atoms in the close proximity to the center of the pore. The adsorbate-adsorbent interaction in SBMOF-2 appears to be similar to the SBMOF-1 case, except in those channels where additional polarizing -OH groups and oxygen atoms serve as strong adsorption sites for C2Hn, through the CH …O interaction. Those single crystal data are confirmed by the experimental gas adsorption and the XRD-DSC studies. In situ XRD-DSC results further suggest that SBMOF-2 displays some network flexibility, which allows accommodation of all the C1-nC4 hydrocarbon gases inside the pore space.\\n\\nAssociated Content\\n\\nSupporting Information.

The C2H4/CH4 and C2H2/CH4 selectivity for SBMOF-1 are lower than those of the Fe-MOF-74 (700 and 200, respectively),29 because of the presence of open metal sites in the activated framework in the latter case, while SBMOF-1 possesses no open metal sites.\\n\\nHowever, the 74 C2H6/CH4 selectivity is more than 3 times higher than for Fe-MOF-74 (20).29 SBMOF-2 uptake of C2Hn is more than 2 times higher than in the case of SBMOF-1 at 298 K and 1 bar, and the difference in maximum uptake between methane and C2Hn is more prominent than for SBMOF-1. SBMOF-2 adsorbs 17.3 cm3/g of methane at 298 K and 64.7, 59.8 and 62.2 cm3/g of acetylene, ethylene and ethane, respectively (Fig. 2b). The maximum uptake of C2Hn in SBMOF-2 at 1 bar, 298K is lower than for prototypical MOFs such as Fe-MOF-74, or MOF-5 but considerably higher than those of other porous materials extensively studied for hydrocarbon adsorption like ZIF-8 or RPM3-Zn.4,24,25,57 Qst values for C1-C2 hydrocarbons adsorbed on SBMOF-2 are lower than in the case of the SBMOF-1 material (Table 1). The calculated C2/C1 selectivity in SBMOF-2 are 26, for C2H6/CH4, 16 for C2H4/CH4 and 18 for C2H2/CH4 (Fig. 2d), also lower than those calculated for SBMOF-1 and FeMOF-74.29 As in SBMOF-1 the only presumed interaction between gas molecules and the pore space is C-H…π, it is expected that the Qst values will decrease with the C-C bond saturation.58,59 However, the Qst values of all three gases are quite similar to each other with the values of 34.8(3), 35.0(5) and 36.3(7) kJ/molGAS for acetylene, ethyelene and ethane, respectively, suggesting that there is no significant influence of the C-C double or triple bond on the adsorbent-adsorbate interaction.\\n\\nIn SBMOF-2 Qst of all C2Hn display also similar values, with 30.3(2), 29.2(1) and 32.3(1) kJ/molGAS for ethane, ethylene and acetylene, respectively. In both materials however, we can see that ethane interacts with the pore surface with the highest energy of the three, in spite of the full saturation of the C-C bond, normally leading to the lower adsorbent-adsorbate energy.\\n\\n58 The C2Hn Qst values for adsorption both on SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 suggest that the size of the molecule and the number of the H-pore surface interactions play a more important role on the resultant energy of adsorption than the saturation of the C-C bond.\\n\\nSBMOF-2 was further tested for the adsorption of heavier C3-nC4 hydrocarbon gases. When looking on the gas adsorption of C1-nC4 alkanes on SBMOF-2, depicted on Figure 3a, we note that the adsorption follows the general trends observed for porous MOFs such as MOF-5.27,60 SBMOF-2 saturates with longer alkanes at lower pressures, and the heavier gas generally displays a lower capacity than the lighter counterpart. Qst becomes higher with an increase in the chain length due to the enhanced electrostatic and dispersion interactions between the adsorbed gases and the pore surfaces (Fig. 3b).61 In mixtures longer chains are preferred over the smaller ones until the point of the maximum selectivity, when the entropic cost of the long chain ordering affects the energy gained from the adsorption.5 The separation performance of industrial fixed bed adsorbents is dictated by a combination of adsorption selectivity and uptake capacity. In order to demonstrate the potential of SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 for separation of hydrocarbon mixtures, we performed transient breakthrough simulations. The results for separation of equimolar 4-component CH4/C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixture using SBMOF-1 at 298 K, with partial pressures of 25 kPa each are presented on Figure 5a.')],\n",
