SYNTHESIS_EXTRACTION = """
You are an expert in reticular chemistry and Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF).
Your job is to extract details about the synthesis procedure for a MOF that has the following names: {MOF_name}
Please be precise and as accurate as possibile. Make sure the synthesis details pertain to ONLY the MOF Names provided. If you cannot find the synthesis details for a given MOF, report that detail as "Not Provided".

Your output should have the following format: 
   - Metal Precursor: The name of all metal precursor(s) used in the synthesis. If there are multiple, seperate them with ", ". Ensure the names are chemically correct and formatted properly. 
   - Organic Linker: The name of the organic linker(s) for the MOF. Use Systematic name(s)/standard abbreviations when possible, include full chemical names in brackets. If there are multiple, seperate them with ", ". Ensure accuracy and proper formatting.
   - Solvent: The solvent(s) used in the synthesis process. Include all relevant solvents and their ratios if provided. If there are multiple, seperate them with ", "
   - Temperature: The temperature at which the synthesis was conducted. If a temperature range is provided, include it.
   - Reaction Type: The general synthesis method used, such as "solvothermal", "hydrothermal", "mechanochemical", etc. Include all types mentioned, in order.
   - Reaction Time: The duration for which the synthesis reaction was carried out. Include units and correct formatting.
   - Synthesis Procedure: A detailed step-by-step summary of how the MOF was synthesized. Ensure clarity and accuracy. Use bullet points to summarize each step.
   - Additional Conditions: Any other experimental parameters mentioned, such as pH, pressure, additives, or special conditions.
   - Justification: The exact sentences from the provided text that describe the synthesis procedure for this MOF.
