    "# Task 4a - Retrieve: Has PCN-46 ever been suggested for Carbon Capture?\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the ability of knowledge graph-augmented LLMs to conduct an advanced literature search. By combining the pre-existing information in our knowledge graph, we have identified a promising MOF candidate for Carbon Capture (PCN-46) based on its similarity to HKUST-1, experimentally measured CO2 uptake, and text-mined expert recommendation. Now, we will use a cross-document agent to search for additional information outside of PCN-46's original synthesis paper"

      "PCN-46, a type of metal-organic framework (MOF), has indeed been explored for carbon capture applications. MOFs like PCN-46 are considered suitable for carbon capture due to their high surface area, tunable pore sizes, and functionalizable structures, which allow for efficient adsorption of CO2 molecules. Specifically, the design of PCN-46 enables it to provide a high density of adsorption sites, which can enhance its CO2 uptake capacity. Additionally, the thermal and chemical stability of PCN-46 can contribute to its effectiveness and durability in practical carbon capture processes. These properties make it a promising candidate for capturing and storing CO2, a critical step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n"

      "ULMOF-5 is not water stable, as indicated by its property of being \"Unstable\" in water ([10.1021/cg100449z]). The lack of water stability can be attributed to several factors intrinsic to the chemistry of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs).\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Solubility of Components**: The summary indicates that ULMOF-5 is soluble in water and methanol ([10.1021/cg100449z]). This suggests that the bonds between the metal ions and the organic linkers in the framework are not strong enough to withstand hydrolysis or solvation by water molecules.\n",

Lithium forms relatively weaker coordination bonds compared to transition metals, making the framework more susceptible to hydrolysis in aqueous environments.\n",

      "ULMOF-5, a type of ultralight metal-organic framework, typically consists of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands. The water stability of such frameworks depends on several factors, including the nature of the metal-ligand bonds, the hydrophobicity of the organic ligands, and the overall structural integrity of the framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Metal-Ligand Bonds**: If ULMOF-5 uses metal ions that form strong, stable bonds with the ligands (such as high-valent metals like Zr or Ti), it is more likely to withstand hydrolysis. Conversely, frameworks with metals that form weaker bonds (like certain divalent metals) might be more prone to hydrolysis in water.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ligand Hydrophobicity**: The organic ligands' hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature also plays a critical role. Ligands that are hydrophobic can help shield the metal centers from water, enhancing stability. If ULMOF-5 contains hydrophilic ligands, water can more easily penetrate the structure and potentially disrupt it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Framework Porosity and Structure**: Highly porous structures with large pore sizes may allow water to penetrate more easily, potentially leading to framework degradation. However, if the framework has a robust 3D structure with cross-linking that prevents collapse, it might maintain stability in aqueous environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, without specific details on the metal ions and ligands used in ULMOF-5, a definitive answer cannot be given. However, understanding these factors can help predict its water stability. If ULMOF-5 is designed with strong metal-ligand bonds and hydrophobic ligands, it is more likely to be water stable.\n"
