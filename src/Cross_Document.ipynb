      "Summarized Procedure: Dissolve 0.03 mol of copper nitrate trihydrate in 250 mL of deionized water to form Solution A. Add 0.02 mol of trimesic acid (TMA) and 0.06 mol Triethylamine (TEA) in 250 mL of ethanol to form Solution B. Mix Solutions A and B and heat under constant stirring to 85 °C. Maintain the temperature isothermally for 3 hours. Cool the solution to room temperature in an ice bath. Centrifuge to produce pristine HKUST-1. Activate the HKUST-1 using slurry state activation, powder state activation, or slurry-powder state activation to remove internal impurities. Use ethanol or methanol as activation agents in a reflux condenser. Conduct the activation process for 3 hours. Centrifuge the activated solution to obtain precipitation and dry at 120 °C to obtain final HKUST-1 powder.\n",

      "Exact Sentences: Firstly, 0.03 mol of copper nitrate trihydrate (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) was dissolved in a 250 mL of deionized water to form Solution A, while 0.02 mol of trimesic acid (TMA) (Sigma Aldrich, 95%) and 0.06 mol Triethylamine (TEA) (Sigma Aldrich, 99.8%, anhydrous) were added in a 250 mL of ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) to form Solution B. These two solutions were then mixed and heated under constant stirring to the pre-set temperature level, i.e., 25, 50, 75, 80, 85 °C, and kept isothermal for a period of time (3, 6 or 9 h). The solution was then cooled down to room temperature in an ice bath and centrifuged to produce pristine HKUST-1, which was activated using slurry state activation, powder state activation or slurry-powder state activation to remove internal impurities.\n",
