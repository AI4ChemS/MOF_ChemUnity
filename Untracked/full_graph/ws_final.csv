""After 1 h, the broad lines characteristic of the TBA cations have been replaced by the thinner line of the TMA ions showing the success of cation exchange. However, concomitantly to this exchange, it can be noted a decrease of the intensity of the bands corresponding to the C–O vibrations and a modification of the bands characteristic to the Mo=O vibrations, which suggests some decomposition of the POMOF material. The C–O bands have totally disappeared after 6 h. It has not been possible so far to find suitable experimental conditions in which the POMOF framework is maintained and the TBA are exchanged. The weak monodentate coordination modes of the trimesate probably account for this instability.""",10.1021/ja201165c

Zn(pymtz)2<|>compound 1,DILDEI01,Water Stability,Unstable,,,"When the crystals of compound 2 were immersed in methanol or water at room temperature, they pulverized slowly. The IR band observed at 1683 cm−1 in 2, which is attributable to the ν(C=O) vibration of the DMF guest molecules, disappears in the pulverized sample. Actually, the IR spectrum (Figure S3, Supporting Information) and the PXRD pattern (Figure) of the pulverized sample coincides with those of 1, suggesting that 2 has transformed into 1. In addition, the Na and O peaks observed in the EDS spectra of 2 disappear in the spectra of the pulverized sample (see Figure S4, Supporting Information), further supporting the transformation from 2 to 1. According to the compositions of 1 and 2, the transformation corresponds to the release of an Na+ cation and a pymtz− anion per formula into the solvent. This may be completed through the dissolution and recrystallization processes. The release of Na+ and pymtz− has been confirmed by IR and EDS analysis on the solid residue of the filtrate obtained by filtering off the pulverized solid: the IR spectrum clearly suggested the presence of the pymtz ligand, while the EDS analysis suggested the presence of Na, C and N, with no evident signal of Cd.

These results can be explained by the breathing behavior. For the rigid interpenetrated frameworks, subtle differences of guest content and composition will lead to different structures, and this transformation is reversible. Therefore, the slight reversible changes in PXRD patterns of compounds−1 and 2 are caused not by collapse of the framework, but by a solvent effect.

Complexes 2 and 3 also show similar types of sinusoidal type adsorption curves (Figure b,c) with large hysteresis resulting from different type of interactions at different pressure points which indicates the presence of two energetically different processes. Similar type of ‘S’ shaped isotherm was also observed in water sorption of MIL-101. The notable hysteresis in the low pressure region indicates that the large polyhedral cages retain some of the water molecules due to the small window aperture. For 2 and 3, the water isotherms are interrupted. This can be attributed to the accumulated water molecules inside the cage which cannot escape easily during the desorption process. Canivet et al. suggested that the interruption can also arise from the weak flexibility of the framework (due to the rotation of the two pyrazole rings in BPz ligand). As compared to high water sorption in 1–3, methanol and ethanol uptake is very less and amounts to nearly or equal to 100 mL g–1 of methanol and 50 mL g–1 of ethanol at 1 atm. The small size of water molecules as compared to methanol or ethanol could be the reason for high uptake of water as there are no open metal or hydrophilic site in 1–3.

Ni-STA-12<|>St Andrews nanoporous material-12,QOVDEL,Water Stability,Stable,Not applicable,,"The rehydration has been found to be rapid and fully reversible. The structure of the spiral inorganic chains is shown in Figure, with NiO4N polyhedra in the chains exhibiting both corner-sharing and edge-sharing. Ni(1)O4N and Ni(2)O4N share an edge, whereas Ni(1)O4N and Ni(3)O4N share a corner: all PO3C tetrahedra remain corner-sharing. Two out of the three different phosphonate groups change their coordination, so that all three of their oxygen atoms as well as the piperazine nitrogen atom are bound to nickel cations. The third phosphonate group, P(3)O3C, remains in its original configuration, with a single P=O bond projecting into the pore space, accessible to adsorbates. The change in local symmetry of Ni(II) sites that occurs upon dehydration is readily observed by UV−visible spectroscopy (Figurea). As-prepared Ni-STA-12 (blue curve) is characterized by the presence of an intense component at about 250 nm, associated with the organic linker and by a complex set of bands in the region of metal d−d transitions (visible and near-infrared) that comprise a contribution at 420 nm, double peaks at 695 and 770 nm, a band at 1280 nm, and a further component at 1950 nm. For Ni(II) inOsymmetry, only three weak bands due to spin-allowed d−d transitions would be expected,hso the appearance of the fourth band in the near-infrared region must be explained by the presence of nitrogen inside the first coordination sphere of Ni(II) sites that disrupts their symmetry. Thermal treatmentin vacuoat 523 K produces major changes in the optical spectrum of the Ni-STA-12 (black curve), especially for the d−d bands (new maxima at 428, 518, 810, 1090, 1800, and 1955 nm), while the contribution due to the organic linker shows only a modest red shift. The number of bands and their broad character suggest that NiO4N polyhedra are intermediate between tetragonal pyramids and trigonal bipyramids. This indicates that the removal of water molecules directly coordinated to Ni(II) species causes a substantial modification of the electronic structure of the metal as a result of changes in symmetry and ligand field.

Therefore, organic solvent/water separation can be performed at very high humidity (i.e., small amounts of organic solvents vs large amount of water), which is close to the practical requirements.

While the structure of 5·5H2O changes upon dehydration to 5‘, this desolvated phase retains crystallinity. It is noteworthy that a sample of 5‘, prepared by heating under vacuum at 200 °C for 10 h, upon exposure to water vapor at room temperature will reabsorb solvent and revert to the original structure as monitored by XRD. This observation suggests that the framework integrity of 5 is maintained after a desorption/absorption cycle and that 5‘ may act as a sorbent of small guest molecules. To test this hypothesis, water vapor isotherms of 5‘ were investigated. As shown in Figure, 5‘ takes up considerable volumes of this gas, 12.1 wt % at 0.103P/P0 and 16.1% at 0.88P/P0.

When a crystal of 4 (mother crystal) was kept in H2O for 2 days, it became shinier and afforded {[Cu(azim)(Cl)]·H2O}(n4′) while maintaining its crystallinity. Single-crystal X-ray studies reveal that both the crystal system and space group change from monoclinic P2/c in 4 to triclinic P1̅ in 4′. The Cu–N bond distances are nearly same, while Cu–Cl distances differ significantly (from 2.448 Å in 4 to 2.801 Å in 4′). Lattice water molecules get encapsulated within the space between 1D chains in 4′. The increment in the Cu–Cl distance in 4′ may be due to strong H-bonding interactions of the chloride with these lattice water molecules. Removal of water molecules from the framework by heating and its readmission occurs in SC–SC fashion resulting in the pedal motion of the diphenyldiazene moiety of the ligand (Figure b). Thus, this pedal motion is reversible in nature. With the pedal motion, an appreciable change in the dihedral angle between the phenyl rings takes place (from 49.66° in 4 to 13.30° in 4′) with concomitant movement of the imidazole rings toward coplanarity (dihedral angle 77.75° to 10.90°).

Na[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH)·8H2O<|>compound 3,FORWAL,Water Stability,Stable,,,"The synthesis of compounds 1−3 was pursued through a facile reaction between Fe(III) and quinic acid in aqueous media. The optimal pH, at which the reactions were developed, was in the range 3−3.5. The adjustment of pH was achieved through addition of KOH (1), ammonia (2), and NaOH (3). The general stoichiometric reaction leading to the formation of compounds 1−3 in Scheme.1

The compounds were easily isolated in pure crystalline form upon slow evaporation at room temperature or addition of alcohol to the reaction mixture at 4 °C over a period of a week. Elemental analyses of the isolated crystalline materials suggested the molecular formulation K[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH)·3H2O for 1, (NH4)[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH) for 2, and Na[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH)·8H2O for 3, respectively. Attempts to quantitatively identify and account for stoichiometrically present chloride ions in the lattice of the derived species showed only spurious amounts. It appears that the use of ammonia, NaOH, and KOH as bases, usually added to raise the pH of the reaction mixture, led to their incorporation into the corresponding lattices of 1, 2, and 3. Further spectroscopic evaluation of 1−3 by FT-IR confirmed the presence of quinate bound to Fe(III), thus lending credence to the proposed formulation. Efforts were also made to pursue the synthesis and isolation of species under identical conditions of molecular stoichiometry of Fe(III):quinate, at higher pH values reaching up to 7. In all of those cases, the ultimately isolated crystalline product was identical to that of 1−3, but the yield was lower. The identity of the crystalline products 1−3 isolated in the extended pH range was proven through (a) FT-IR spectroscopy, and (b) X-ray cell determination of single crystals of the respective compounds.

All three compounds 1−3 were insoluble in organic solvents, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, chlorinated solvents (CHCl3, CH2Cl2), toluene, and DMF. They were all stable in the air at room temperature for long periods of time.

The information provided by the multifaceted characterization of 1−3 reflects an important feature of the Fe(III) assembly in solution: that there is a neutral charge on the likely complex form [FeL2H−1]0 arising upon dissolution of 1. It suggests that the produced aqueous species can traverse cellular structures and interact further with both low molecular and high molecular mass targets. Thus, albeit a low pH structural variant, complex 1 (or 2 and 3) provides an expediently soluble form of iron, [FeL2H−1]0, one that potentially elicits interactions in biologically relevant fluids, not unlike those encountered in plant fluids.",10.1021/ic800356v

The K+ ions are located between the layers. The closest atom to a K+ ion is N7 belonging to the nonbridging cyano group, with a K−N7 separation of 2.766(13) Å and a C7−N7−K angle of 131.5(11)°. The second shortest separation is K−O(1W) equal to 2.883(11) Å. K+ is surrounded by nine other nitrogen and carbon atoms with separations ranging from 3.031(17) to 3.38(2) Å. The structure has a two-dimensional character with anionic double-sheet layers parallel to the bc plane, and K+ and noncoordinated water molecules situated between the layers. The partial dehydration not only suppresses the spin reorientation, but also shifts Tc up to 72 K and increases the hardness of the ferromagnet. The upward shift of Tc may be attributed to the fact that the release of noncoordinated water molecules situated in the gap between the layers makes these layers closer to each other. The coercivity in the partially dehydrated material is probably due to the structural defects created by the release of water molecules. It would be quite interesting to obtain structural information on the partially dehydrated phase. Such a study is underway. When a single crystal of K2Mn3(H2O)6]Mo(CN)7]2·6H2O is subjected to a dynamical vacuum with a primary pump for 3 days at room temperature, the noncoordinated water molecules are released. The external shape of the crystal is retained, but its magnetic properties are deeply modified. The χMT versus T curve for the partially dehydrated material again reveals ferromagnetic interactions.

Steep uptake adsorption in the case of H2O at low pressure region (P/Po ≈ 0.04) can be justified by considering the strong interactions between the adsorbate with adsorbent after filling the unsaturated Zn(II) site by one H2O molecule which experiences strong interaction. The strong interaction with unsaturated Zn(II) site of H2O is further supported by the incomplete desorption profile of H2O.,10.1021/cg500149s

Zn(l-L)(Br)2<|>MOF2<|>2,IBICED,Water Stability,Stable,,,"The guest-free frameworks of MOFs1–4 reported in this paper show high affinity for water, irrespective of different structural variation. It is worth mentioning that only a handful of Zn-based MOFs reported in literature can withstand moisture. Upon exposure to moisture, Zn-based MOFs undergo phase transformation, which leads to decrease in gas sorption. Few well-known MOFs, like MOF-5 and MOF 177, show this kind of behavior. Recently, water-stable, methyl-modified MOF-5 was successfully synthesized by incorporation of a methyl group in the parent ligand of MOF-5. To provide further evidence of water affinity apart from crystallographic information, MOF1 was extensively studied by various experiments. MOF1 shows a reversible transformation in the presence of water vapor. After evacuation at 150 °C for 2 days, the dehydrated polycrystalline sample of 1 (confirmed by PXRD, IR, and TGA) was exposed in a closed chamber saturated with water vapor. The single-crystalline nature of MOF1 comes back within 6–12 h (Figure a), which is confirmed by IR, TGA, and crystallography. FT-IR spectra of the evacuated MOF1 sample collected at time intervals of 1 h showed a gradual increase in the intensity of the water peaks after exposure of 1 to moisture (Figure b), which further confirms the high affinity of 1 for water. The water affinity of 1 and 2 was also examined by water adsorption isotherms. Surprisingly, we found that MOF1 shows 12 wt % water vapor uptake (150 cm3/g at STP), whereas MOF2 shows 6 wt % (75 cm3/g at STP), about half at a relative pressure (P/Po) of 0.9 (Figure b). It is quite clear that MOF2 has less water affinity compared to MOF1, though the framework arrangements in 1 and 2 are similar. The CO2 adsorption isotherm indicates much less uptake (25 cm3/g for 1, 20 cm3/g for 2) than predicted on the basis of X-ray crystallography and indicates a low degree of interaction points inside the pore (Figure S27).",10.1021/ja2078637

After 3 days, both the main reflection at 2θ = 12.0° and the absorption band at 515 nm were essentially recovered compared with those observed for the newly synthesized 2. This recovery confirmed a large degree of reversibility for the H2O-induced structural changes: the H2O molecules can coordinate to the Co#2 center, regenerating its octahedral coordination geometry, and H2O molecules can diffuse within the structure, re-establishing the H-bonds between them and the functional groups (mainly of the adenine).",10.1021/acs.cgd.5b00218

Cd(btec)0.5(bimb)0.5<|>compound 5,DAXROL,Water Stability,Stable,,,"The designed construction of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been of intense interest, due to their intriguing aesthetic structures and topological features, as well as their promising applications in molecular magnetism, molecular sensor, heterogeneous catalysis, drug delivery, molecular sorption and so on. Most recently, considerable attention has been paid to developing new photocatalytic materials based on MOFs.−The advantages of MOFs as photocatalyst lie in the fact that the presence of organic linkers and transition metal centers, resulting in different ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions, makes MOFs versatile and potentially tunable photocatalysts. Furthermore, MOFs usually exhibit absorption bands in the visible region, which indicate MOFs may undergo photochemical processes and exhibit responses upon visible-light excitation. Chen and co-workers have reported the synthesis and characterization of new uranium-containing materials, which show rich structural features and encouraging photophysical properties. Garcia and co-workers have studied MOF-5 as a semiconductor for photodegradation of phenol in aqueous solutions and water stable Zr–benzenedicarboxylate MOF as photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. Preliminary ab initio results by Civalleri et al. suggest a significant decrease in the band gap of MOF-5 when changing the benzenedicarboxylic acid linker for larger organic molecules.,Our recent study has been mainly focused on the syntheses and construction of new MOFs from accessible multicarboxylic acids and imidazole-based spacers. A Cd-containing MOF, a Gd-containing 3D supramolecular framework and two isostructural trinodal 4-connected 3D frameworks were found to be photocatalytically active, which prompted us to synthesize new water-insoluble MOFs with improved photocatalytic performance, especially visible-light-driven MOF-based photocatalysts. As an extension of our work, in order to examine the photoactivity of the MOFs by varying the metal centers incorporated in the structures, the conjugated 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (H4btec) and 4,4′-bis(1-imidazolyl)biphenyl (bimb) were chosen as the starting materials together with different divalent metal ions. Utilizing hydrothermal technique, five new MOFs, M(btec)0.5(bimb) (M = Co (1), Ni (2), Cu (3), Zn (4)) and Cd(btec)0.5(bimb)0.5 have been obtained. Interestingly, compounds1,2, and5represent the rare examples of MOFs with high photocatalytic activity for dye degradation under visible light and good stability toward photocatalysis. Compared to the MOFs constructed from 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate acid and bimb in our previous work, the more delocalized π electrons of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid may facilitate the LMCT transitions and decrease electronic band gap of the MOFs1–5, which can be useful for the development of visible-light-driven photocatalysts of MOFs.",10.1021/cg2016512

Thorough investigation using single crystallography and XRPD methods discloses that they are of another concomitant polymorphism involving 2 and a third topological isomer of [Co(mpe)2(NCS)2]∞, 3. The network structure in 3 has a catenane isomeric relation to that of 1. Thus, while 2-D rhombic grid layers constituting 3 are almost equivalent to those found in 1, they are not interpenetrated. Instead, they are stacked and staggered relative to each other so that the SCN groups protrude through the cavity of the adjacent sheet (Figure). In this manner, the voids are effectively filled and, consequently, a closely packed structure results. The crystal of 3 includes no solvent molecules. Variation of the assembly conditions does not significantly influence the polymorphism for the above case. However, in another attempt to obtain a pure polymorph, a mixture of 2 and 3 was immersed in refluxing water for several days, and then, only crystals of 3 were found to remain. To clarify this phenomenon, the same treatment was done with the pure crystals of 2. When they were immersed in reflux water for 12 h, a portion of them was found to be converted to 3. And, after the immersion for 2 days, their complete transformation to 3 was revealed by XRPD measurement. When the resulting powders of 3 were immersed in warm CH3OH for 2 days, any change was not observed in XRPD experiment (Figure).

It is also worth mentioning that the dehydrated forms of all three frameworks selectively adsorb CO2 over N2 and that the adsorption study of 3′ reveals the formation of a rare amorphous MOF. Moreover, the water adsorption profiles show stepwise adsorptions in all three cases, which are attributed to their structural transformation on the basis of the very strong coordination affinity of water molecules with the unsaturated metal ions and the hydrogen-bonding affinity of water molecules with the free O atoms of the carboxylate groups in the framework. Therefore, it may be concluded that the close monitoring of the reversible structural transformation in all three cases will enlighten us for the understanding of crystal-to-crystal and crystal-to-amorphous transformations, which are essentially useful for the design of frameworks having the ability to interconvert in the presence of external stimuli. The TGA curves of 1′–3′ show single-step weight loss at high temperature (Figures S6–S8), indicating the complete absence of coordinated solvent molecules. When the dehydrated phases of all three compounds were exposed to water vapor environment for 7 days, they returned to their original crystalline phases, indicating the reversible nature of the structural transformations even in the case of 3′, which is basically an unusual amorphous-to-crystal transformation. Nevertheless, we also exposed the dehydrated phases of above-mentioned three compounds (1′–3′) to different polar coordinating solvents (MeOH, EtOH, and THF), but surprisingly, we could not observe any structural change in 1′–3′ upon exposure to these solvents (Figures S12–S14).

The geometry of the aluminum atom was determined to be trigonal bipyramidal for compound 1d; therefore rearrangement of the inorganic framework occurred, reducing the free volume (Figure). However, for compound 2d the aluminum atom has a distorted square pyramidal geometry (Figure). The slight change in geometry resulted in a wider channel. The large channels allows for easier reabsorption of water molecules. The change in free volume and the coordinately unsaturated metal are believed to be the main influences on the stability of the dehydrated phases of 1 and 2.",10.1021/cg5005215

In the vast majority of spin glasses, the microscopic conditions of site disorder and frustration are concomitant.15,16 The above observation suggests that spin frustration is important to the spin-glass behaviour of 1·2H2O. Note that the frustration creates a multidegenerate, metastable, frozen ground state for the spin glass, and it is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for a spin glass.\n\nThe magneto-structural correlation indicates that there exists a strong structural anisotropy in 1, which may lead to metamagnetic-like behaviours, such as in the cases of 1·HCONH2 and 1·MeOH.32,33 The reason why 1·2H2O does not have a metamagnetic-like behaviours is not yet clear. Presumably, the different contributions of the guest–host hydrogen bonding, magnetic anisotropy, as well as the alignment of the moment to 2D lattice in the crystal lattices, may play a cooperative role for this phenomenon.32,34 From a magnetic point of view, these compounds are of additional interest for three reasons. Firstly, the new triangular arrangement of the spin carriers is of theoretical importance with regard to frustration9,10 and to the question of long-range order in two dimensions.35 Secondly, the guest molecules can tune magnetic exchanges without drastic host-framework change, and such a strategy may also allow introduction of other spin carriers, optically active molecules and electron or hole carriers for creating structures with combined properties.1,2 Thirdly, when the layers are well separated, they can be considered as multiple stacks of single layer magnets.36,37\n\nConclusions\n\nThis work demonstrates a rare example of single-crystal-to-singlecrystal transformations of the highly stable, pillared layered microporous 3D MOF 1·2H2O triggered by dehydration, rehydration, and two-step guest exchange into 1·MeOH or 1·HCONH2 by X-ray single-crystal diffraction, which underscores the potential afforded by rational molecular assembly with in-situ generated ligands for the design of microporous molecular magnets. The stable, microporous magnetic MOF not only exhibits a new 2D geometrical frustration topology different from the Kagome lattice ´ and complex magnetism due to the influences of multiple metal sites, intra- and inter-layer exchanges, spin–orbit coupling, and geometrical frustration, but also allows the formation of different guest–host hydrogen-bonding interactions via alterations of the guest molecules. The results illustrate that such slight structural modifications via crystal-transformation, along with the guest– host interactions, can tune the geometrical frustration behaviour and the intra-layer antiferromagnetic ordering, leading to unprecedented, dramatic changes of magnetic properties. Therefore, this work represents a systematic study of the modulation in spin-frustrated microporous magnetic system upon alterations of guest molecules within a robust host-lattice,7,11,38 and supports the optimistic forecast that crystal engineering may allow systematic design of magnetic microporous MOFs.1–8\n\n.\n\nAm\n\n12\n\n/2024\n\n0/8 N 1\n\nO\n\nRonto Ity Of To\n\nErs\n\nD By Univ\n\nAde\n\nDownlo\n\n. 06 20 Y\n\n1 Jul\n\nEd On 3\n\nSh\n\nPubli\n\nstructural collapses, resulting in the obvious changes of the magnetic interaction paths in the magnetic hosts,1,3,5 because of the limited robustness of the host MOFs. Therefore, it is still difficult to make a thorough study of the modulation effect of the guest molecules on the cooperative magnetic properties of such microporous MOFs. The inherent difficulties for the study can be summarized as: (1) the ultimate design is never easy; (2) the final products are often poorly crystallized, hence hampering characterizations of their structures and magnetic properties; (3) the overall thermal stability is generally limited to the intrinsic thermal stability of the organic ligand and, therefore, is lower compared with typical inorganic porous materials such as zeolites and (4) since ""Nature abhors a vacuum"", many porous MOFs collapse in the absence of the guests.1,2 Robust three-dimensional (3D) microporous MOFs built by pillared layers provide an opportunity for systematic study of the relationship between the guest and magnetic-property through guest exchanges that may perturb the magnetic host. Furthermore, the ""inorganic"" layers in pillared layered MOFs may be of the so far rarely observed, but theoretically important 2D spin topologies and spin-frustrated lattices, such as the Kagome or triangle ´ lattice.1,9–11 Meanwhile, with rationally arrayed corner- and edgeshared triangular lattices, a new spin-frustrated 2D topology may be constructed. Such geometrically frustrated antiferromagnetic materials have attracted much attention in recent years due to their propensity to adopt unusual, even exotic magnetic ground states which remain poorly understood.1,9–11\n\naMOE Key Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry/State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, P.

China † The HTML version of this article has been enhanced with additional colour images.\n\nLattices with the spin carriers lying at the vertices of triangles provide examples of spin-frustrated materials in the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling.9,10 According to Goodenough rules,20 l-O-bridged Co1 ··· Co2, Co1 ··· Co2a and Co1 ··· Co1b interactions are predicted to be antiferromagnetic since the superexchange Co–O–Co angles are only 101.6(1) ∼ 122.0(1)◦ (Table 2). The anti–anti or syn–syn carboxylate bridges may also favor antiferromagnetic coupling, while the syn–anti carboxylate bridges (Co2 ··· Co2a and Co1b ··· Co2) may favor ferromagnetic coupling.21 Two types of triangular frustrated ""plaquettes"" are created in 1·2H2O (Scheme 2a). Among them, one type of threemembered ring trio is formed by one OCT (via the l-O-bridges) and two vertex-sharing TBP (through syn–anti 1,3-carboxylate bridges) polyhedra, furnishing an isosceles triangle (IT1, pale blue). Meanwhile another trio is formed by two of edge-sharing OCT and one of corner-sharing TBP polyhedra (through one- or three-atom bridges, respectively), giving rise to a distorted isosceles triangular lattice (IT2, green). The IT1 triangles with vertex-sharing TBP polyhedra form a D-chain structure (Scheme 2b), which has been the subject of extensive theoretical investigations, yet very few real examples are known.11b Adjacent antiparallel D-chains are linked each other with edge-shared OCT pairs, furnishing a distorted infinite 2D lattice (Scheme 2b). The 2D lattice is best described as a new incomplete occupation of the triangle net different from the Kagome-triangle lattice (Scheme 2c,d), in which ´ the adjacent D-chains are interlinked by sharing the same vertices. It is worthy of note that the vertices of the adjacent D-chains in the lattice of 1·2H2O are not shared, which is another topology of possible topological spin frustration.9–11 To our knowledge, no incomplete-triangle lattice of the type found in 1·2H2O has been reported.9–11 Here, the topological frustration should be expected to cause a large degeneracy in the ground state manifold, and long-range magnetic ordering may be suppressed or significantly reduced as a result of competing antiferromagnetic interactions. Frustration may also be a consequence of disorder, which produces a random combination of ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic interactions, and ultimately leading to spin glass behaviour at low temperature.9,10,16\n\n.\n\nAm\n\n12\n\n/2024\n\n0/8 N 1\n\nO\n\nRonto Ity Of To\n\nErs\n\nD By Univ\n\nScheme 2 Topologies of the superexchange-mediated 2D magnetic lattice in 1·2H2O (a) (solid circle: OCT, hollow circle: TBP; bold blue-lines: two l-alkoxo bridges, bold black-line: triple carboxylate bridge, thin purple-line: double carboxylate bridge, and thin peach-blow line: 1,1-carboxylate bridge, thin cyan line: 1,3-carboxylate bridge; Symmetry codes: (a) 0.5 − x, 1 − y, 0.5 − z; (b) 0.5 − x, 1.5 − y, −z;, filled triangular frustrated ""plaquettes"" in 1·2H2O (b), Kagome (c) and triangular (d) 2D lattices. ´\n\nAde\n\nDownlo\n\n. 06 20 Y\n\n1 Jul\n\nEd On 3\n\nSh\n\nPubli\n\nThermal Stability Of The Mof In 1·2H2O\n\nThe TGA curve of 1·2H2O shows that the first weight loss of 8.2% between 25 and 260 ◦C corresponds to the loss of the lattice water molecules (ca. 8.8 wt%), and that the MOF could retain structural integrity to ca. 280 ◦C and 340 ◦C in flowing air and dinitrogen, respectively (Fig. S3‡). Such striking thermal stability can be ascribed to the strong intra- and inter-layer connections. It was also observed that anhydrous 1 was found to be active, taking up water molecules to form 1·2H2O. The rehydration rate depends on the time in the open air, the 20–200 ◦C TGA measurement (Fig. S4‡) in air revealed that 1 reabsorbed atmospheric water to 1·0.75H2O after one day, to 1·1.5H2O after three days, and to recovery (1·2H2O) after six days.\n\nCrystal Transformations Via Dehydration, Rehydration And Guest Exchange\n\n‡ Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Additional plots and magnetic data for the complexes. See DOI: 10.1039/b603337g It has been noted that coordination complexes with in-situ generated ligands are of great interest in both coordination chemistry and organic chemistry for discovery of new organic reactions and understanding the reaction mechanisms, as well as for preparation of the coordination architectures that are usually inaccessible via direct use of the ligands.12 In fact, we were unable to generate ""inorganic"" laminated compounds using the promising malate (ma) anion as a versatile ligand bearing a hydroxyl group. As fumaric acid can be hydrolyzed into maleic acid,13 in our continuing effort to generate new magnetic MOF materials using the hydrothermal technique,14 we chose fumaric acid (and maleic acid or anhydride) as the precursor to prepare a CoII MOF in the presence of isonicotinic acid (Hina) as an additional ligand, giving rise to [Co2(ma)(ina)]n·2nH2O (1·2H2O), in which fumaric acid was converted in situ into racemic ma ligands. These ma ligands connect the CoII ions into 2D spin-frustrated lattices with mixed (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic coupling) and multiple exchange-bridges (different coupling intension) between the magnetic centres,9,10,15,16 whereas the ina anions act as molecular pillars to form a robust, microporous 3D MOF (Scheme 1). We report herein the crystal structure of 1·2H2O featuring a new spinfrustrated lattice and complicated magnetic properties that can be modulated by guest removal and exchange via single-crystalto-single-crystal transformations into dehydrated 1, 1·MeOH and 1·HCONH2 (Scheme S1‡).\n\nScheme 1 The hydrothermal synthesis of 1·2H2O.\n\nExperimental Preparation Of 1·2H2O\n\nFumaric acid (0.116 g, 1 mmol) (or maleic acid/maleic anhydride) in an aqueous solution (6 mL) of NaOH (0.080 g, 2 mmol) was mixed with isonicotinic acid (0.123 g, 1 mmol) in water (2 mL), which was then added to an aqueous solution (2 mL) of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.582 g, 2 mmol).

The rigid ina-pillared metallic-layered structure could retain 3D structural ordering upon guest removal and exchange. By soaking guest-free host (1) in MeOH and methanamide (HCONH2) solutions, single crystals of dehydrated 1 were transformed into single crystals of 1·MeOH and 1·HCONH2, respectively, without apparent host-structural changes. 1 can also be rehydrated into 1·2H2O. The guest-inclusion crystals have been characterized by X-ray single-crystal diffraction at 293 K and 93 K, confirming the single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations and providing detailed information of the guest molecules confined in the subnanospace and host–guest and/or guest–guest hydrogen-bonding interactions. The magnetic behaviours of this family of porous magnetic materials are complex due to the influences of multiple metal sites, intra- and inter-layer exchanges, spin–orbit coupling, as well as geometrical frustration, which show magnetic ordering at <2 K, 3.5 K, 3.5 K, and 8 K for 1, 1·MeOH, 1·HCONH2, and 1·2H2O, respectively, due to the different size of guest molecules along with the different host–guest interaction, which may slightly modify the path of magnetic exchange, decrease the intensity of the spin-frustration in the 2D lattice, and cooperatively enhance the magnetic ordering temperature.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMagnetic microporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted current interest for multifunctional molecule-based materials.1–3 In contrast to the crucial requirements of shortbridged moment carriers of super-exchange for long-range magnetic ordering, porosity of MOFs usually relies on the use of long connecting ligands, magnetism and porosity are conflicting to each other. Therefore, design of a porous magnet presents a great challenge.1,2,4 The documented porous magnets include metal– organic radical complexes,4,5 pillared layered metal hydroxides,6 Prussian blue analogs,7 and carboxylate-bridged materials, and so on.8 Some interesting investigations have been reported to deal with modulation of the magnetic properties of porous magnets upon guest exchange or evacuation.3,5–8 Many of them have been shown to be of obvious host-structure transformations and/or\n\n.\n\nAm\n\n12\n\n/2024\n\n0/8 N 1\n\nO\n\nRonto Ity Of To\n\nErs\n\nD By Univ\n\nAde\n\nDownlo\n\n. 06 20 Y\n\n1 Jul\n\nEd On 3\n\nSh\n\nPubli\n\nRehydration Of 1\n\nStanding of 1 in air (T = 22(2) ◦C, relative humidity = 35(5)%) for six days gave rise to the rehydrated 1·2H2O.\n\nMagnetic Measurements\n\nDetailed ac and dc magnetic data were collected using a Quantum Design MPMS XL-7-SQUID magnetometer on phase-pure samples from crushed single crystals.

After heating to 380 K and subsequent cooling down to 300 K, the magnetic data of 1 were collected in the range 2–300 K at 100 Oe. The data for 1·MeOH were recorded on cooling the sample in a helium flow from 275 to 2 K to avoid escape of the guest molecules. The field-cooled magnetization measurements in external fields around the critical metamagnetic field were conducted on cooling from 30 K. The isothermal magnetization data were collected at T < 10 K, in fields of up to 70 kOe. The ac measurements were performed on cooling the samples in a field of 5 or 6 Oe oscillating at 11, 111, 311, 665, 997 Hz.\n\nPowder X-Ray Diffraction (Pxrd)\n\nThe purities and crystallinities of the bulk samples were checked by PXRD using a Rigaku D/max 2200 diffractometer.\n\nAM 3 :5 :45 12 /2024 0/8 n 1 o ronto ity of To ers d by Univ ade Downlo\n\n06 20 y 1 Jul ed on 3 sh Publi\n\nX-Ray Crystallography\n\nAll diffraction data were collected on a Bruker Smart Apex CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo-Ka radiation (k = 0.71073 A˚ ) at 293 or 93 K. Absorption corrections were applied by SADABS. All the structures were solved by direct methods and refined with full-matrix least-squares technique using SHELXTL.17 All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters except the solvent molecules. The aqua hydrogen atoms were located from the difference Fourier map at the final states of refinement. For all structures, the refinements revealed two-fold disorder of two alkyl (C8, C9) atoms of ma. The disordered guest molecules in 1·MeOH and 1·HCONH2 were refined in two orientations, and were subjected to geometric restraints during the refinements. On the other hand, the aqua oxygen atoms in 1·2H2O were refined anisotropically for both the 93 K and room temperature data. All of them were subjected to geometric restraints during the refinements. The water hydrogen atoms in 1·2H2O were located in the electron density map. The refinement of 1 gave two residual electronic peaks (1.17 and 1.34 e A˚ −3) in the void of 1 at the final stage of structural refinement, which though smaller than that (1.49 e A˚ −3) around a CoII atom within a distance of 0.90 A˚ , may imply the presence of trace water molecules during the X-ray measurement as well as lower quality diffraction data. The crystallographic details are provided in Tables 1 and S1‡, while the selected bond distances and angles are listed in Tables S3 and S4‡.\n\nCCDC reference numbers 257660–600572 for 1·2H2O, 1, 1·MeOH, and 1·HCONH2, respectively.\n\nFor crystallographic data in CIF or other electronic format see DOI: 10.1039/b603337g See http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/ for crystallographic data in CIF or other electronic format.\n\nResults And Discussion Crystal Structures\n\nX-Ray single-crystal diffraction reveals that all the four compounds crystallize in the same space group C2/c with maximum Table 1 Crystallographic data and structure refinements differences in the unit-cell dimensions with volumes being 0.16 A˚ (0.74%) and 37.0 A˚ 3 (1.3%) at 293 K, and 0.48 A˚ (2.0%) and 19.3 A˚ 3 (0.70%) at 93 K, respectively (Table 1).\n\nIn the as-synthesized 1·2H2O, the asymmetric unit consists of one ina, one ma and two CoII ions, as well as two lattice water molecules. Co(1) is coordinated by four ma oxygen atoms (Co– O 2.013(3)–2.149(3) A˚ ) and one nitrogen atom and one oxygen atom from ina (2.161(5), 2.089(4) A˚ ) to form a distorted CoO5N1 octahedron (OCT), while Co(2) is only ligated by four ma oxygen atoms and one ina oxygen atom (Co–O 1.939(4)–2.114(3) A˚ ) to furnish a distorted CoO5 (Fig. S1†) trigonal-bipyramid (TBP).\n\nEach ma is coordinated to six CoII ions through two 1,1,3-bridging carboxylate and one l-alkoxo group, while each ina ligand is ligated to three CoII ions (Scheme 1, Fig. S1‡). This coordination mode therefore results in eight coordination bonds to six CoII ions for each ma, which is the highest coordination number of ma so far documented.18 The two kinds of CoII ions are alternatively bridged by ma into an infinite undulated [Co2(ma)]n+n layer (Fig. 1a,b) with different adjacent Co ··· Co separations via five exchange-paths (l-O-bridges: Co1 ··· Co2 3.509(1) A˚ , Co1 ··· Co2a 3.455(1) A˚ , Co1 ··· Co1b 3.312(1) A˚ , different 1,3-carboxylate-bridges: Co2 ··· Co2a 5.392(1) A˚ , Co1b ··· Co2 5.351(1) A˚ ). This layer is very rigid and can be simply described by alternative connection of the helices of corner sharing OCT and TBP polyhedra by edges-sharing OCT running along the a-axis, which represents the first example of an ""inorganic"" metal–oxgen layer interconnected uniquely by carboxylate and l-alkoxo groups without the presence of any hydroxyl groups. Such layers are further pillared by l3-ina ligands into a 3D microporous MOF with the layers stacking in an ABAB mode (Fig. 1c) and the interlayer distance of ca. 9.09 A˚ .\n\nAs no hydrogen-bond donor is present in the host MOF, it can only act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor.18 The opening size of the saddle-like channels corresponds to 25.8% potential solvent accessible volume (668.6 A˚ 3 per unit-cell volume of 2784.4 A˚ 3),19 where the guest water molecules are anchored to the layers by guest– host hydrogen bonds [O1W ··· O7 2.78(2), O2W ··· O4 2.97(2) A˚ , Table 3]. These guest molecules are also interlinked by hydrogen bonds [O2W ··· O2Wg 3.18(3), O1W ··· O2Wg 2.70(2) A˚ ]\n\nCompound 1·2H2O 1·2H2O 1·MeOH 1·MeOH 1·HCONH2 1·HCONH2 1 T/K 293 93 293 93 293 93 293 Formula C10H11Co2NO9 C10H11Co2NO9 C11H11Co2NO8 C11H11Co2NO8 C11H10Co2N2O8 C11H10Co2N2O8 C10H7Co2NO7 FW 407.06 407.06 403.07 403.07 416.07 416.08 371.03 a/A˚ 23.550(2) 23.226(2) 23.457(3) 23.521(2) 23.583(3) 23.702(3) 23.482(3) b/A˚ 10.082(1) 10.107(1) 10.094(1) 10.028(1) 10.104(1) 10.062(1) 10.060(1) c/A˚ 14.978(2) 14.890(1) 15.044(2) 14.985(1) 15.060(2) 15.020(2) 14.950(2) b/◦ 128.47(1) 127.81(1) 128.249(2) 128.618(1) 128.540(2) 129.07(2) 128.34(2) V/A˚ 3 2784.4(5) 2761.6(3) 2797.3(7) 2761.5(3) 2806.8(6) 2780.9(5) 2769.8(6) Dc/g cm−3 1.942 1.958 1.914 1.939 1.969 1.988 1.780 l/mm−1 2.429 2.449 2.412 2.443 2.409 2.431 2.422 Rint 0.0357 0.0324 0.0600 0.0358 0.0398 0.0360 0.0278 R1  (I > 2h ) 0.0457 0.0538 0.0505 0.0583 0.0569 0.0490 0.0471 wR2  (all data) 0.1124 0.1229 0.1398 0.1458 0.1644 0.1237 0.1295 GOF 1.16 1.08 1.000 1.22 1.06 1.13 1.02 Dqmin/max/e A˚ −3 −0.57–0.83 −0.72–1.16 −0.86–0.66 −0.98–2.31 −1.09–1.37 −0.69–1.40 −0.55–1.49 Free volume 25.8% 24.9% 25.1% 25.1% 26.6% 25.6% 24.1%\n\nR1 = -Fo| − |Fc-/-Fo-,wR2 = [w(Fo 2 − Fc 2) 2/w(Fo 2) 2] 1/2.\n\n20 Y\n\n1 Jul\n\nEd On 3\n\nSh\n\nPubli\n\nFig. 1 Perspective views of the coordination environments of CoII ions (a) [Symmetry codes: (a) 0.5 − x, 1 − y, 0.5 − z; (b) 0.5 − x,1.5 − y, −z], the layer (b) and the 3D host MOF structure (c) of 1·2H2O.

The plausible reason behind the proton conductivity at higher temperature is due to the strong and continuous hydrogen bonding between coordinated and lattice H2O molecules which hold the H2O molecules till 72 1C (confirmed by VT-SCXRD). However, in the case of Ca–BTC–DMF, the lattice H2O molecules are arranged as discrete hydrogen bonded clusters, which hold the H2O molecules till 40 1C. Ca–BTC–DMA and Ca–BTC do not contain any such continuous hydrogen bonded network within the framework. Hence we believe that strong hydrogen bonding between coordinated and non-coordinated H2O molecules plays a key role in high temperature proton conduction in Ca–BTC–H2O.",10.1039/c2cc34006b

La(H5DTMP)·7H2O<|>Compound 1,CAVSUP,Water Stability,Stable,,,"The as-synthesised compound contains seven lattice waters which may be removed at moderate temperatures while the crystalline metal–organic framework is maintained. The anhydrous material shows high affinity for water but the rehydrate stoichiometries depend upon the experimental conditions. The crystal structures indicate that the lanthanum coordination environment is made-up exclusively by phosphonate oxygens, i.e. none of the water molecules are coordinated to the La3+ centres. This structural feature may have implications in the luminescent properties to be studied. The incorporation of a ligand possessing an aliphatic –(CH2)6– chain provides substantial framework flexibility as the structures are adapted to the guest molecule (water) content. The anhydrous material is ultramicroporous and the specific surface for CO2 adsorption (at 273 K and approximately 1 bar of CO2) is 84 m2 g−1. Finally, 1 is a proton-conductor with a conductivity of 8 10−3 S cm−1 at RT and an activation energy of 0.25 eV. The water release pattern measured by TGA is in agreement with the structural study. The first mass loss corresponds to the loss of the five lattice waters located in the centre of the channels. The second mass loss is due to the two water molecules strongly H-bonded to the phosphonate groups. There is a plateau from ∼ 423 to ∼503 K where no mass loss is observed. For temperatures higher than 523 K, the material decomposes in two steps (523–673 K and 673–1223 K). The total observed mass loss of ∼ 51.1 % at 1273 K corresponds well to the calculated 50.17 % (based on the formation of La(PO3)3, which was identified by its powder pattern, PDF #00-033-0717). The dehydration process has been followed by thermodiffactometry (see Fig. 5). In agreement with the TGA study, full dehydration takes places at 423 K. Heating at this temperature results in a crystalline dehydrated phase, La(H5DTMP) (2). The process is only partially reversed after cooling at room temperature and exposing 2 to the air for 1 h. Under these conditions, only two water molecules are incorporated within the framework. This partial rehydration leads to a third crystalline phase, La(H5- DTMP)·2H2O (3) that seems to remain stable at room temperature. 3 was kept at room temperature for 7 days in a closed vessel under a humid atmosphere, produced by saturated NaCl, and with the powder pattern of the solid remaining unchanged. Both phases, 2 and 3, were autoindexed using the DICVOL06 program in monoclinic unit cells related to the initial cell. The structure was optimised by the Rietveld method17 using the program GSAS15 and the graphic interface EXPGUI.18 The following soft constraints were imposed in order to preserve chemically reasonable geometries for the phosphonate, amine groups and alkyl chains:/PO3C tetrahedron/P–O (1.53(1) Å), P–C (1.80 (1) Å), O⋯O (2.55(2) Å), O⋯C (2.73(2) Å),/N(CH2)3 amine group/N–C (1.50(1) Å), C⋯C (2.45(2) Å) and/alkyl chain/C–C (1.50(1) Å), Cchain⋯Cchain (2.50(2) Å). Hydrogen atoms were not included in the refinements. The final weight factor for the soft constraints was 20. Only three isotropic atomic displacement parameters were refined, one for the La atom, a second for the P atoms and a third one for the rest of the atoms. The crystal structures for the anhydrous, La(H5DTMP) (2), and rehydrated phases, La(H5DTMP)·2H2O (3), were obtained by Rietveld refinement using as starting model the crystal structure of 1. The Rietveld plots for 1–3 are given in the Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI†) and the relevant crystallographic data are presented in Table 1. Crystal structures have been deposited at CCDC and the reference codes are also given in Table 1. Thermal analysis Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data were recorded on an SDT-Q600 analyzer from TA instruments. Initially, the temperature was varied from RT to 1273 K at a heating rate of 10 K min−1. Measurements were carried out on a sample in an open platinum crucible under a flow of air. Secondly, a set of measurements were carried out 4046 | Dalton Trans., 2012, 41, 4045–4051 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 under N2 flow, saturated with water at 298 K, to characterise the release and uptake of water by 1. On the other hand, a thermodiffractometric study for 1 was carried out for the sample loaded in an Anton Paar HTK 1200 N chamber under static air. Data were collected at 303, 423, 453 and 473 K with a heating rate of 5 K min−1 and a delay time of 10 min to ensure thermal stabilization. The data acquisition range was 4–80° (2θ) with a step size of 0.008° and an equivalent counting time of 100 s step−1. Textural characterization The nitrogen sorption–desorption isotherms were measured in a Micromeritic ASAP 2020 apparatus. The samples were degassed under high vacuum and the isotherms, obtained at 77 K, were analyzed by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Carbon dioxide sorption isotherms were measured in a Micromeritic ASAP 2020 apparatus. The samples were degassed at 463 K for 2 h and the isotherms obtained at 273 K were analyzed by the Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) method.19 The adsorption study of NO (at 298 K) was carried out following the experimental procedure described elsewhere.20 The samples were outgassed at 463 K under vacuum for 2 h. Conductivity characterization Electrical characterization was carried out on a cylindrical pellet (∼10 mm of diameter and ∼1 mm of thickness) obtained by pressing ∼0.02 g of sample at 1000 MPa, for 2 min. The pellet was pressed between porous C electrodes (Sigracet, GDL 10 BB, no Pt). Impedance spectroscopy data were collected using a HP4284A impedance analyzer over the frequency range from 20 Hz to 1 MHz with an applied voltage of 0.2 V. Electrical measurements were taken at 289, 291, 293, 295 and 297 K under a 5%H2–Ar flow and at 98% relative humidity over the temperature range. All measurements were electronically controlled by the winDETA package of programs.21 Results and discussion La(H5DTMP)·7H2O (1) was obtained by room temperature crystallization from acidic solutions containing La3+ and H8DTMP. Compared to d-block transition metal-containing MOFs,2 LnMOFs have been relatively much less studied. Porous frameworks are rather scarce, because they usually present less oriented metal-linker bonds and the bulky lanthanides usually exhibit high coordination numbers, which result in dense solids.3 For solid state applications, such as solid sensors, light-emitting materials or proton conductors, two- or three-dimensional network compounds are required. Due to the high affinity of the rare-earth ions for oxygen-containing species, carboxylate-based ligands have been often used as the linkers of preference, yielding robust framework architectures. For example, Harbuzaru et al.1d have prepared 3D microporous Ln-MOFs, by appropriate selection of the carboxylate ligand under hydrothermal conditions. The products combine a set of well-defined properties in the same crystal, including high gas adsorption, anisotropic photoluminescence and magnetic properties. Microporosity characterisation 1 was outgassed under high vacuum at room temperature for 15 h or at 473 K for 2 h. Both treatments resulted in the anhydrous material, 2, as determined by the mass losses. On the one hand, the N2 isotherm gave no porosity with specific surface lower than 3 m2 g−1. On the other hand, the CO2 isotherm (not shown), collected at 273 K and under pressure up to 1 bar, gave a micropore surface area of 84 m2 g−1, deduced from the Dubinin–Radushkevich19 equation, and an adsorption capacity of 0.35 mmol g−1. We highlight that the isotherm is not saturated at 1 bar and higher pressures would be necessary to access the full pore volume of the structure. This is in agreement with the shape of the 1D channels in 2. Higher pressures would allow a gateopening mechanism that may allow a higher gas uptake. A highpressure synchrotron powder diffraction study is planned in order to characterise this flexible framework as a function of the loaded species (CO2, N2, etc.). Some preliminary studies on NO adsorption have been also carried out for 2. Fig. 7 shows the isotherms for NO adsorption– desorption at 298 K. The NO adsorption capacity at ∼ 1 bar was 0.95 mmol g−1 (or 2.85 wt %), similar to that found in zeolites24 and Sn(IV) metal diphosphonates.25 The hysteresis of the isotherm is significant, indicating a strong irreversible adsorption of NO inside the pores. This irreversible adsorption is likely due to the bonding of the NO molecules to the lanthanum cations. Proton-conducting characterisation A preliminary ionic conductivity study of 1 has been carried out as the structural study showed 1D channels filled with water molecules (see Fig. 3 and S6†) that may allow proton-conductivity to take place. The impedance study shows that indeed 1 exhibits proton conductivity. Fig. 8 shows the real (Z′) and imaginary (Z′′) parts of the complex-plane impedance data for 1. Cole–Cole circular arc fitting gave a conductivity (σ) of 8 10−3 S cm−1 at Fig. 6 TGA evolution (green curve) of 1 under a water saturated N2 flow.

The temperature dependent study is also given in Fig. 8. Arrhenius plot shows a linear behaviour with an activation energy of 0.25 eV. This small number is within the range typically attributed to a Grotthuss transfer mechanism via water molecules, 0.1–0.4 eV.26 A full proton-conductivity study is out of the scope of this work and it will be reported elsewhere. The RT obtained value of the proton conductivity is higher than that recently reported for a metal phosphonate MOF material, σ = 3.5 10−5 S cm−1 at 298 K and 98 % RH.27 The activation energy for the proton transfer process derived from bulk conductivity was 0.17 eV. Values of the same magnitude for the proton conductivity, σ = 1.1 10−3 S cm−1, at room temperature have been very recently reported for a carboxylateMOF.28 In this case, the activation energy of the proton conductivity process was nearly the same 0.23 eV. Multifunctional phosphonate ligands are alternative organic linkers, leading to a variety of thermally and chemically stable Ln-MOFs architectures.4 However, exercising control of the dimensionality and crystal structure of phosphonate-based LnMOFs still remains a difficult task. So far, only a few examples of three-dimensional networks have been reported. In these cases, the frameworks are constructed by chains of edge-sharing lanthanide polyhedral connected by phosphonate groups.5 Recent progress in design of new polyphosphonic ligands has opened the way to the tailor-made synthesis of hybrid inorganic– organic materials.6 Diamino tetraphosphonic acids are versatile organic linkers because they may contain diverse functionalities in between the peripheral phosphonate groups and hence new compounds with chemical and structural peculiarities may be prepared. In fact, a number of diamino tetraphosphonates with different alkaline or transition metals showing chain, layered or three-dimensional open framework structures have already been †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Fig. S1–S3: XRPD Rietveld plots for compounds 1–3; Fig. S4: Comparison of the raw powder patterns for Ln(H5DTMP)·7H2O (Ln = La, Sm); Fig. S5: framework view for 1 showing the 1D channels; Fig. S6: lattice water molecule chain within the channel of 1.

Experimental Materials All starting compounds were from commercial sources and used as received, without further treatment. Deionized (DI) water was used for all syntheses and procedures. La2O3 (99.5 %), was from Aldrich, USA and SmCl2·6H2O (99+ %) was from Alfa-Aesar, USA. K6(H2DTMP) (Dequest 2054, 33.5 % stock solution) was from ThermPhos-Dequest, Belgium. Preparation of lanthanide tetraphosphonate products La(H5DTMP)·7H2O (1). 1 mL of a 33.5% stock solution of K6(H2DTMP) (0.58 mmol) was added to 20 mL of DI water. Preparation of lanthanide tetraphosphonate products La(H5DTMP)·7H2O (1). 1 mL of a 33.5% stock solution of K6(H2DTMP) (0.58 mmol) was added to 20 mL of DI water. The pH was then adjusted to ∼ 2 by using consecutively 5 M and 1 M HCl solutions. Separately, a quantity of La2O3 (0.127 g, 0.39 mmol) was suspended in 30 mL of DI water and then dissolved by consecutive addition of 5 M and 1 M HCl solutions, adjusting the pH to about 0.9. The two solutions were then mixed and the final pH was adjusted to 1.2 with a 1 M NaOH stock solution. The resulting clear colourless solution was left undisturbed for 2 months, after which time a microcrystalline white solid appeared. Alternatively, solid H8DTMP (Dequest 2051) can be used instead of the K6(H2DTMP) stock solution. Anal. Calcd (%) for LaP4N2O19C10H39: 15.92%C, 5.21%H, 3.71%N. Found: 15.07%C, 4.92%H, 3.62%N.

Sm(H5DTMP)·7H2O. The same procedure was used as for La(H5DTMP)·7H2O (1), except that the metal source was SmCl2·6H2O and the final pH was 0.76. By following the same procedure as above for Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, no Ce-containing product was isolated, except halite (NaCl), as confirmed by its powder diffraction pattern. Crystal structure determination Laboratory X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were collected on a PANanalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer in a Bragg–Brentano reflection configuration by using a Ge(111) primary monochromator (Cu Kα1) and the X'Celerator detector. XRPD patterns were auto-indexed using the DICVOL06 program13 and the space groups derived from the observed systematic extinctions were consistent with P 21/m or P 21. For the structural determination of 1, powder X-ray diffraction data were collected at the high resolution beamline ID31 of the ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, (Grenoble, France). A wavelength of 0.2998 Å was selected with a doublecrystal Si (111) monochromator and calibrated with Si NIST (a = 5.43094 Å). The Debye–Scherrer configuration was used with the sample loaded in a rotating borosilicate glass capillary of diameter of 1.0 mm. The overall measuring time was ≈100 min in order to have satisfactory statistics over the angular range 1.0–15° (in 2θ). The data from the multi-analyser Si(111) stage were normalised and summed into 0.003° step size with local software. Its crystal structure was solved following an ab initio methodology. Initially the centrosymmetric space group P 21/m was selected for the extraction of the integrated intensities using the Le Bail method14 implemented in the GSAS package.15 The structure determination was carried out by direct methods using the programs Sir200616 by default setting. The best solution gave the atomic positions for the lanthanum atom, two phosphorus atoms and some oxygen atoms of both phosphonate groups. The missing atoms were localized by difference of Fourier maps. However, not all water molecules could be found in P 21/m. The crystal structure could be satisfactorily completed in the non-centrosymmetric space group P 21 which is in agreement with the hydrogen-phosphonate stoichiometry of 1. Furthermore, the fit in space group P21 was better than in P 21/m.",10.1039/c2dt11992g

The selective sorption of CO2 rather than N2 gas can also be attributed to the significant quadrupole moment of CO2 (1.4 1039 cm2), which generates specific interactions with the host framework.10 The enthalpies of CO2 adsorption (Qst) were also calculated9 from the adsorption isotherms measured at 273 and 298 K, and found to be around 33.76–35.36 kJ mol1 (Fig. S8–S10, ESIw), implying relatively strong interactions between the CO2 and the pore surfaces.11 In addition, 1a was also subjected to vapor adsorption (Fig. 3c).

The TG curve of the rehydrated compound corresponds well with that of the virgin compound 1 (Fig. 5), thus the dehydration–rehydration processes shown by thermogravimetric analyses are reversible.

3. A comparison of X-ray diffraction patterns of the rehydrated species and [Mg(Pdc)(H2O)]n (1) indicates that the structure of the compound remained unaltered after rehydration. The X-ray diffraction patterns of 1 and the rehydrated species correspond well with the powder patterns simulated from single crystal X-ray data (Fig. 6).",10.1039/c2dt00057a

Compound 1 was first reported by Qiu and co-workers in 2006. This compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4322. The coordination sphere of the DyIII ion is made up of seven oxygen atoms arising from one terminal water molecule (O4) and six carboxylate groups of BTC ligands (O1, O1A, O2, O2A, O3, O3A). The seven-coordinated DyIII ions are characterized by a distorted pentagonal-bipyramidal environment, as calculated using the SHAPE software. The carboxylate groups bridge neighbouring dysprosium ions, forming a 1D helical chain along the c-direction, with a DyDy distance of 4.7316(6) Å. These chains are linked together through BTC ligands to form a 3D porous framework. The shortest interchain Dy-Dy separation distance is 8.1213(3) Å. The anhydrous phase of 2 was obtained by calcination of 1 under vacuum at 240 1C for 12 h. The terminal coordinated water molecules and guest molecules were removed, while a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation was accomplished. Single crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the structures of host porous frameworks in 1 and 2 were almost the same. The main difference was that the terminal water molecule is subtracted in 2, which could be confirmed by both single crystal X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy, and this affects the coordination environments of DyIII ions. As the water molecule was removed, the coordination geometry of the dysprosium ion changed from pentagonal-bipyramid to distorted trigonal prism. This process also altered the distance between the neighbouring dysprosium ions. The intrachain Dy-Dy distance decreased to 4.3149(5) Å, whereas the shortest interchain Dy-Dy distance increased to 8.5392(2) Å. If 2 was immersed in the mixture of water and DMF, it changed to the rehydrated phase 1a. Single crystal X-ray diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, and element analysis revealed that 1a was the same as 1. The terminal water molecule returned to the original position, so the coordination environment of DyIII ion recovered from distorted trigonal prism to pentagonal-bipyramid. The distances between DyIII ions were also restored. This reversible structural change gave us an opportunity to achieve reversible manipulation of slow magnetic relaxation behaviour.",10.1039/C3CC43747G

Putting the dehydrated sample 2′ under the same humid conditions, the PXRD pattern is poorly matched with that of 2. Nevertheless, if the dehydrated sample 2′ is exposed to water for a longer time, some changes can be observed in the PXRD pattern. The peaks at 2θ = 9.2°, 10.1°, 10.7°, 11.7°, 13.4°, 16.7°, 17.2°, 17.9°, 23.1°, 27.1°, 28.1° and so on, which match well with those in 2, are slowly emerging. Thus we can infer that the PXRD of the dehydrated sample 2′ could be in accordance with that of 2 if the readsorption time of water is adequate. Besides, the TGA curve of the sample exposed to water for 120 hours (Fig. S3, ESI†) shows that there is a 10.9% weight loss, which corresponds to the loss of about 5.5 water molecules in the compound, supporting that water molecules are re-assimilated tardily in dehydrated sample 2′. The above experimental facts indicate that the water aggregates play a key role on the stability of the two compounds.

From the structural point of view, 1 can be regarded as an inorganic 3D framework constructed by Co4POM and Co2+ cations where the formed channels are decorated by pendant TPT ligands in the π–π stacking mode (Fig. S6†). Although some 3-D frameworks built by the sandwich-type Keggin dimer have been reported, to the best of our knowledge, 1 still represents the first 3-D 8-connected trivacant Keggin POM derivative based on the Co4POM subunit.18c Topologically, the 3-D architecture is a 8-connected net, in which the dimer Co4POM acts as a 8-connected node (Fig. 2e). Topological analysis reveals that the simplified framework features a 8-connected 3D network with the Schläfli symbol (424·64), which corresponds to a bodycentered cubic (bcu) topology that is rare for coordination polymers (Fig. 2f ).20 The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared 1 was tested by degradation of organic dye solutions under visible light which is one of the effective ways to eliminate environmental pollutants.3 The band gap of compound 1 was measured by a solid state ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflection measurement method at room temperature. According to the equation (αhν) 2 = K(hν − Eg) (where hν is the discrete photo energy, α is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the band gap energy, and K is a constant), the extrapolated values (the straight lines to the x axis) of hν at α = 0 give absorption edge energy corresponding to Eg = 2.10 eV for compound 1 (Fig. S7†). To study the photocatalytic activity of compound 1, we selected rhodamine B (RB) as a model of the dye contaminant to evaluate the photocatalytic effectiveness. The experiments were performed in typical processes. The reaction system was stirred mechanically under visible light irradiation during the whole process and the characteristic absorbance at 555 nm of RB was selected to monitor the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation process in aqueous solution by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, the absorbance of RB gradually decreased with increasing time of visible light irradiation in the presence of 1 and H2O2. Interestingly, approximately 39% of RB was decomposed during the first 20 min. After 120 min, the RB in the solution almost disappeared and the decoloration rate of RB reached 96.3% (curve a). The final decoloration rate of RB was 98.6% after 150 min, which indicates that further expanding the reaction time does not effectively increase the decoloration rate at the later reaction stage. Control experiments of several parameters including H2O2, photocatalyst 1 and light were conducted under similar conditions and the corresponding curves for variations in the decolorization rate of RB solution are plotted in Fig. 3. Experimental results showed that about 9.2% RB was degraded after 150 min if only compound 1 was added to the reaction solution (curve b), indicating that H2O2 is a necessary electronacceptor in this system. Meanwhile the decolorization rate in the absence of 1 (curve c) was 10.6% after 150 min, suggesting that 1 is an effective photocatalyst. When the reaction system containing both 1 and H2O2 was performed in the dark, the degeneration rate was fairly low (about 12.4% after 150 min), which proves that the catalytic reaction almost does not work or works slowly in the absence of light irradiation (curve d). The repeatability of catalytic activity for photocatalysts is a very important parameter to assess the photocatalyst practicability. The reproducibility of the photocatalytic degradation activity on 1 was also studied with a constant RB concentration (12 mg l−1) and catalyst dosage (0.6 g l−1) in each cycle. Republic of China.

Notice that the A-α-PW9 unit in the starting material was transformed to the B-α-PW9 unit in 1, because the seven exposed surface oxygen atoms in the vacant site of the B-α-PW9 unit favor the formation of the Co4 cluster.19 As shown in Fig. 1, each dimeric Weakley-type Co4POM subunit is bound to eight Co2+ cations which consist of two different Co2+ cations (Co2 and Co5) and can be categorized into two groups with a 4 : 4 distribution fashion. Four Co2 (Co5) atoms in which two Co2 (Co5) atoms are linked to the adjacent terminal oxygen atoms (Ot) of the same Co4POM subunit are arranged in the diagonal direction (Fig. S4†). Co2 has a six-coordinated octahedral geometry which is defined by five oxygen atoms from two terminal oxygen atoms (Ot) of two different Co4POM subunits and three water molecules [Co–O: 2.064(11)–2.179(10) Å], and one nitrogen atom from the TPT ligand [Co–N: 2.136(11) Å]. Co5 exhibits the octahedral coordination environment completed by four oxygen atoms from two terminal oxygen atoms (Ot) belonging to two different Co4POM subunits and two water molecules [Co–O: 2.087(11)–2.131(9) Å], and two nitrogen atoms from two TPT ligands [Co–N: 2.120(12)–2.123(11) Å]. Interestingly, in the structure of 1, one hydrated Co atom (Co6) coordinated with six water molecules acts as a counterion to balance the charge of the structure [Co–O: 2.057(11)–2.150(12) Å]. TPT ligands demonstrate two different kinds of coordination modes. One acts as a monodentate ligand (μ1-TPT), in which only one pyridine on the TPT participates in coordination with Co5 atoms. The other one acts as a bidentate ligand (μ2-TPT), in which two pyridines coordinate with Co2 and Co5 atoms. It is noticeable that two pairs of Co2 and Co5 atoms bound to the same Co4POM in the diagonal plane are clamped by two μ2-TPT ligands which can stabilize the Co4POM subunit (Fig. S5†). The most striking structural feature in 1 is that each dimer Co4POM subunit joins eight dimer Co4POM subunits through the linkage between the terminal oxygen atoms (Ot) and Co atoms (Co2 and Co5), resulting in an unprecedented 3D 8-connected framework. The special arrangement of dimer Co4POM subunits induced by the peripheral eight coordinated Co atoms forms large one dimensional channels along the b axis which are filled with pendant μ1-TPT and μ2-TPT ligands and free water molecules (Fig. 2a and b). All the TPT ligands in the channel are in parallel arrangement and obviously there exist strong offset π–π stacking interactions between these TPT ligands.

The flat band position (Vfb) determined from the intersection is approximately −0.81 V vs. Ag/AgCl (i.e. −0.61 V vs. NHE) for 1. Since it is generally suggested that the bottom of the conduction band in many n-type semiconductors is more negative by about 0.10 V than the flat band potential,22 the conduction band (LUMO) of 1 can be estimated to be −0.71 V vs. NHE, while the valence band (HOMO) can be calculated to be 1.39 V vs. NHE according to a band gap of 2.10 eV for 1 as described above. The redox potentials of RhB and excited RhB are 0.95 V and −1.42 V vs. NHE, respectively.8,23 Thus, direct electron transfer from RhB to 1 is thermodynamically favourable. Taking the band-gap value and band-edge positions of 1 into account, a proposed photodegradation mechanism of organic dyes is deduced that after excited by visible light, electrons (e−) in the HOMO (VB) of 1 were excited to its LUMO (CB), with the same amount of holes (h+) left in VB. Meanwhile, the electrons from RhB* can also be injected into the LUMO of 1. All these injected electrons were further trapped by H2O2 to yield the oxidizing species OH•; further, radicals attack organic substrates and degrade dye (Fig. S9†).24 In previous reports, Zhao et al. have proven that microporous solid K3PW12O40 can act as a photocatalyst under visible light to degrade organic dyes where organic dyes serve as photosensitizers.8 Cao et al. prepared two visible light photocatalysts by assembling Wells–Dawson type polyoxometalates with a hexacopper phosphate cluster photosensitizer or cucurbit[n]uril, which both exhibited good photodegradation of organic dyes.14a,b Fu et al. have demonstrated that doping porous coordination polymers (PCPs) with typical photocatalyst PW12O403− anions can combine the photocatalytic activity of POM with the light harvesting property of PCPs, which showed highly efficient photocatalytic degradation behavior without POM leaching.14c Compared with the examples mentioned above, 1 was obtained by directly hybridizing photocatalytic Co4POM with a photoresponse ligand, which represents the first 3D organic–inorganic photocatalyst based on Co4POM under visible light. Conclusions In summary, a novel 3D organic–inorganic hybrid framework constructed from sandwich-type Co-substituted polyoxoanions Co4POM and N-heterocyclic TPT molecules was reported, which shows a rare 8-connected bcu topology. The band gap of 1 shows that it can be used as a photocatalyst and the photocatalytic activity was tested by degradation of organic dye solutions under visible light irradiation. The results showed that 1 demonstrates highly efficient photocatalysis activity even for five catalytic cycles and the photocatalyst is stable during the reaction process. This research may give an opportunity for the fabrication of more functional photocatalysts based on the hybrid strategy, and a related study is ongoing.

As a bridge between them, photocatalysts have been paid more and more attention.2 The removal of organic pollutants with high toxicity and hard degradation properties from wastewater aided by photocatalysts has become a hot research topic.3 As a matter of fact, inorganic or organic semiconductors and alloys have been widely investigated as photocatalysts and some of them show an outstanding catalytic reaction capacity.4 Polyoxometalates (POMs), as metal-oxide clusters of early transition metals Mo, W, V, and so on,5 have been studied as a green and cheap photocatalyst for the removal of organic pollutants or transition metal ions from water.6 However, there are three main drawbacks slowing down the development of POMs acting as photocatalysts:7 (i) high solubility in aqueous solution or low stability under catalytic conditions makes them difficult to recover and recycle; (ii) POMs are characterized by a low surface area that in many cases limits their applications;8 (iii) most POMs showed low visible light photocatalytic activity because of a high energy gap between the well-defined HOMO and LUMO. Usually, only less than 5% solar light could be utilized by POMs themselves, which is the most severe obstacle restricting their application in photocatalysis. To overcome the first two problems, researchers have made numerous attempts, for example, to disperse POMs on various supporting materials including silica,9 metal oxides10 and organic polymers.11 Through these methods, the shortcomings of recovering and recycling catalysts could be avoided; however, new questions arose such as ill-defined structures, non-uniform sites, POM leaching and low POM loading.12 As for the third problem, additional photosensitizers are always introduced into the photocatalytic system.13 Thus, the reasonable design and preparation of POM-based composite heterogeneous photocatalysts with high stability and visible-light activity for the efficient use of solar energy remain an appealing challenge.14 Inspired by (a) the classical tetra-CoII-substituted sandwichtype Keggin aggregate [Co4(H2O)2(B-α-PW9O34)2] 10− (Co4POM) is a highly efficient photocatalyst in the presence of a photosensitizer and an oxidant;15 (b) aromatic N-heterocyclic components could be used as light sensitizing fragments;16 (c) the flexible coordination mode of multidentate aromatic N-heterocyclic components will provide potential combination sites for metal ions and POM anions forming 3D extended structures; (d) recent research studies have shown that some coordination complexes of CoII and pyridine derivatives can act as photocatalysts;17 in this contribution, we designed and synthesized a novel heterogeneous POM-based photocatalyst [Co(H2O)6]- [(TPT)2Co2(H2O)5]2[Co4(H2O)2(B-α-PW9O34)2]·10H2O (1) constructed from Co4POM subunits and light sensitizing tris- (4-pyridyl)triazine (TPT) molecules. This organic–inorganic hybrid compound not only exhibited highly efficient visible light photocatalysis activity, but also was very stable and easily separated from the reaction system for reuse. As far as we know, it is the first 3D organic–inorganic hybrid framework constructed from sandwich-type Co-substituted polyoxoanions Co4POM.18 Needle-like crystals of 1 were readily obtained by a hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 4 days.† Single-crystal X-ray †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Schemes, figures and CIF files giving additional structural figures, PXRD, TGA, IR and crystallographic data.

[Cu2(H2btp)(H2O)2(bipyridine)]<|>compound 2,VUMBIQ,Water Stability,Stable,,,"As suggested by the results of TG, compounds 2–4 accommodate guest water molecules in the as-synthesized states, and the reversible structural changes of these compounds were observed by the XRD experiments with the water drop treatment mentioned above. Therefore, compounds 2–4 potentially adsorb water vapor at ambient temperature. Fig. 7 shows water vapor adsorption isotherms at 303 K on compounds 2–4. As expected, all compounds show apparent adsorption uptakes at low relative pressure and large hysteresis loops, which are often observed in the adsorption isotherms of the flexible MOFs.62–65 The pore volumes calculated using Dubinin– Radushkevich (DR) analysis66 are 0.047 mL g−1 (2), 0.095 mL g−1 (3), and 0.083 mL g−1 (4), respectively. Compared with the void volumes estimated from the crystal structures, the pore filling percentages are 32% (2), 61% (3), and 46% (4), respectively. It is not straightforward that the use of longer pillar ligands does not give higher adsorption uptakes. It should be noted that the percentages are in a considerably wide range and far from a complete filling of 100%. These adsorption results suggest that the compounds show different adsorptivities of small molecules with different structural responses based on the molecular species and accommodation conditions. Further investigation of molecular adsorptivities on compounds 2–4 was performed through CO2 and ethanol adsorption experiments. Fig. 8 shows CO2 adsorption isotherms on compounds 2–4 at 273 K. Interestingly, compounds 2 and 4 have almost no uptake; however, compound 3 shows a steep uptake at the low pressure region like the water adsorption isotherm. By optimizing the degassing conditions under vacuum at room temperature, compound 3 shows an increase of CO2 uptake up to 76 mg g−1, indicating that compound 3 can essentially adsorb CO2 molecules. In addition, all compounds 2–4 also adsorb ethanol vapor at 303 K or below at P/P0 = 1 with hysteresis loops in all isotherms (ESI, Fig. 5S and 6S†). These adsorption results with different kinds of molecular species clearly indicate that these compounds show moleculedependent gas adsorptivities. Because the molecular size of ethanol is larger than those of N2 and CO2, the adsorption properties of compounds 2–4 are not explained by a common molecular sieving effect.60 As indicated by the XRD experiments with the water drop treatments, compounds 2–4 have framework flexibility, and after the pretreatment they should be nonporous forms as suggested by the N2 adsorption experiments. These adsorption selectivities should appear as a result of the molecular affinities to the surfaces, inducing structural transformation in their flexible frameworks.67–70 Conclusions In this paper, the synthesis, crystal structure, and gas adsorption properties of a series of copper phosphonates with different N-donor ligands are reported.

The H4bpt2− ligands are parallel-aligned along the caxis with the average distance of 4.1 Å and bridged by copper(II) ions in the direction of the a-axis to form 2D copper phosphonate sheets (Fig. 5b and c). The 2D sheets are pillared with pyr ligands and furthermore bridged through the long Cu(1)– O(6) bonds to form a 3D framework structure with an interlayer distance of 9.3 Å. Because of the short interlayer distance and well developed bridging networks between the layers, compound 1 proves to have no accessible void space, which is estimated by PLATON software59 using the single crystal structural data of compound 1. Thermal and structural investigations TGA curves of compounds 1–4 are shown in Fig. 3S (ESI†). All compounds show weight losses between room temperature and 200 °C, which correspond to removal of water molecules inside and/or outside the crystals. The weight loss percentages of compounds 2–4 are much higher than those of compound 1, indicating a larger amount of adsorbed water in the 1D pores. In compound 1, the weight loss of 9.3 wt% between 200 and 400 °C corresponds to the combustion of the pyrazine ligand (calcd 9.5 wt%). There are some large weight losses at higher temperature of 400–800 °C, which should be because of decomposition of H4bpt2− and condensation of hydroxyl groups of phosphonate groups. The expected final products at 1000 °C are Cu2P2O7 and P2O5, which correspond to 53.7 wt% of compound 1 (calcd 53.3 wt%). The crystalline phase of Cu2P2O7 was confirmed using XRD patterns of the residue after the TG measurement of compounds 1, 3, and 4. In compound 2, there are three-step weight losses of 30.2 wt% between 200 and 800 °C, which should be due to removal of bpy ligands, decomposition of H2bpt4−, and condensation of hydroxyl groups of phosphonates (calcd 29.9 wt%).

Dalton Transactions Paper This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015 Dalton Trans., 2015, 44, 12717–12725 | 12721 residue at 800 °C was 52.8 wt% and estimated as Cu2P2O7 and partially remaining P2O5 (calcd 54.3 wt%). Compound 3 shows the weight loss of 3.0 wt% between 200 and 400 °C, which should stem from condensation of the hydroxyl groups of H2bpt4− ligand (calculated at 2.5%). The weight loss of 32.1 wt % of compound 3 in 400–800 °C corresponds to the decomposition of bpe and H2bpt4− ligand (calculated at 34.4%). The TG curve of compound 4 is very similar to that of compound 3 and a similar decomposition process should occur in the heating process. The weight percentage of the residue of compound 4 at 800 °C is 60.2 wt%, which is well matched with the calculated percentage of Cu2P2O7 and 0.9P2O5 (60.3 wt%). In order to investigate the structural stability of the framework, pillared layered compounds 2–4 were examined. TG analysis indicates that compound 2 releases water molecules at ca. 100 °C and a part of bpy ligands at ca. 250 °C with the help of a NMR experiment. Accordingly compound 2 was heated at 100 °C and 250 °C under vacuum, and the XRD patterns of the samples were measured after exposure to air (Fig. 6). Through the removal of adsorbed water molecules, compound 2 kept the crystallinity with slight structural changes (Fig. 6a and b). The partial removal of bpy ligands resulted in a different crystalline phase. Because of the broadening of diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of the samples treated at 250 °C, the vacuum-heating treatment should also induce a decrease of crystallite size and/or crystal distortion (Fig. 6a–c). Water was again dropped on the treated samples, resulting in recovery of XRD patterns similar to that of the pristine sample. These results suggest that compound 2 keeps the pillared layered network and shows structural reversibility during water accommodation/removal. It is interesting that the samples heated at 100 °C and 250 °C and with the following water treatment show very similar XRD patterns, although the sample treated at 250 °C has less amount of pillaring bpy molecules. Further heat treatment at 380 °C gave almost amorphous and weak diffraction peaks recognized as Cu2P2O7 phase, indicating collapse of the pillared layered structure. Compounds 3 and 4 release water molecules below 150 °C and also showed similar Fig. 5 (a) The local coordination environment in compound 1.

Therefore, it should be noted that these pillared layered compounds have potential to show a flexible nature through molecular accommodation depending on molecular species. Gas adsorption analysis Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured on compounds 2–4 at 77 K. Although all compounds 2–4 have accessible void space with pore entrances large enough to adsorb N2 molecules (minimum dimension: 3.0 Å)60 based on the crystal structures, all compounds showed almost no uptake at low relative pressure. The BET surface area61 of compounds is 1.1 m2 g−1 (2), 2.8 m2 g−1 (3), and 3.0 m2 g−1 (4), respectively. These results indicate that these compounds change their structures from open forms to non-porous forms through the removal of guest molecules by the pretreatment.

A hydrothermal reaction of copper oxide, 1,3,5-benzenetriphosphonic acid (BTP = H6bpt), and N-donor ligands with different lengths gives three new and one previously reported copper organophosphonates. X-ray crystal structural analyses revealed that compound 1, [Cu2(H4btp)2- (pyr)] (pyr = pyrazine), forms a dense 3D network structure without open pores, and on the other hand, compounds 2–4, [Cu2(H2btp)(H2O)2(L)] (L = bipyridine for 2, 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene for 3, and 1,3-bis- (4-pyridyl)propane for 4), show topologically identical pillared layered frameworks with micropores. The framework structures are composed of copper phosphonate layers and N-donor ligands expanding the interlayer distances. Guest water molecules occupy the pores and are removable by drying treatment. Compounds 2–4 adsorb and desorb water vapor reversibly with structural transformation. Interestingly, compounds 2–4 adsorb ethanol vapor in spite of no adsorption of N2 molecules, indicating selective adsorption properties based not on the molecular size but on the molecular affinities to the surfaces. Introduction Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are composed of metal ions or metal clusters and organic ligands, have emerged as a new porous material with structural diversities and designability.1–10 Especially, MOFs provide finely controlled structures by selecting and combining building units and therefore the functionalities of the MOFs have been explored from academic and practical points of view. Metal organophosphonates are an important class of MOFrelated materials and have received much attention because of their potential applications in such areas as molecular adsorption/separation,11–15 catalysis,16–19 ion exchange,20–22 magnetism,23–28 and proton conductivity.29–33 They often exhibit relatively high thermal and chemical stability because of stable P–C bonds and perhaps the presence of stable metal phosphonate clusters or networks in their frameworks. They also show various connection networks with different numbers of P–O–M bonds between metals and phosphonate groups, resulting in a variety of framework structures like chains, layers, and three dimensional open-frameworks. Compound 4 has layer motifs represented as [Cu2(H2btp)- (H2O)2] and the layers are pillared with bpp ligands to form quasi-rectangular pore windows of 10.3 × 14.0 Å estimated from the distances between copper ions. The pores are separated from each other by the bpp molecules and the 2D layers, resulting in the formation of 1D channels along the b-axis. The estimated total accessible pore space is 791.9 Å3 which is 27.6% of the unit cell volume calculated using PLATON software.59 Both compounds 2 and 3 are crystallized in the orthorhombic space group Cmca, which is a supergroup of the space group Pbam of compound 4. The framework structures of compounds 2 and 3 are topologically identical to those of compound 4. All copper(II) ions in compounds 2 and 3 are crystallographically equivalent and are in five-coordination geometry similarly to the copper(II) ions in compound 4. The copper(II) ions in compounds 2 and 3 are coordinated by one nitrogen atom from the N-donor ligands, and four oxygen atoms from three different phosphonates and from a water molecule that terminate framework connectivity. Each H2bpt4− ion bonds to six copper(II) ions through three phosphonate groups (Fig. 2). In detail, one phosphonate group has four P–O–Cu bonds with four copper(II) ions and the other two have one P–O–Cu bond, respectively, in one H2bpt4− ion. The former phosphonate group should be doubly deprotonated to have two negative charges, and the latter two phosphonate groups should have one negative charge to keep the charge balance. The single crystal structure analysis of compound 3 supports the deprotonation of the phosphonate groups, because of the averaged shorter P–O bond (1.53 Å) in the former phosphonate groups and the longer one (1.55 Å) in the latter phosphonate groups. As a result, the chemical composition of the layer is shown as [Cu2(H2btp)(H2O)2]. There are metal phosphonate clusters composed of four copper(II) ions and six phosphonate groups (Fig. 3a), and these clusters are bridged by aromatic rings of H2bpt4− to form a distorted rhombic shaped network (Fig. 3b). The network expands in the b–c plane to form a 2D layered structure (Fig. 3c and d). The 2D sheets are pillared with N-donor ligands through copper(II) ions with different interlayer distances of 14.2 Å (2) and 16.9 Å (3) to construct 3D open framework structures, in which the N-donor ligands are aligned parallel to each other along the b-axis with the distances of 3.4–3.5 Å (2) and 3.2–3.6 Å (3) (Fig. 3e and 4). As one can see in Fig. 3e and 4, both the compounds have pseudo-rectangular shaped pores along the b-axis. As mentioned above, the crystal structures of compounds 2–4 are topologically identical and are recognized as isostructural pillared layered materials with different interlayer distances of 14.2 Å (2), 16.9 Å (3), and 17.8 Å (4). The layered structures in compounds 2, 3, and 4 are closely similar but slightly different from each other. In compounds 2–4, the network topology in the layers is exactly the same; however, the orientation of the clusters is different due to the different orientation of the phosphonate groups. The difference of the layered structures appears in the occupied area of the layers. The calculated area per [Cu8(H2btp)4] unit, which corresponds to the unit cell area in the b–c plane for compounds 2 and 3 and that in the a–b plane for compound 4, is 179 Å2 (2), 164 Å2 (3), and 161.3 Å2 (4), respectively, indicating that the layered structures of compounds 3 and 4 are more similar to each other and more dense than the layer in compound 2. Compounds 3 and 4 also have pseudo-rectangular shaped 1D pores. Using the atomic centers of copper(II) ions as points of the rectangle, we measured the edge of the rectangle as ca. 9.8 × 11.2 Å (2), 10.4 × 13.4 Å (3), and 10.3 × 14.0 Å (4). The accessible void is 1217 Å3 (23.9%) for compound 2, 1280.2 Å3 (23.2%) for compound 3, and 791.9 Å3 (27.6%) for compound 4, respectively, calculated using PLATON software.59 Because of the half value of Z (Z = 4) in compound 4 compared with that in compounds 2 and 3 (Z = 8), the void in compound 4 is doubled to be 1583.8 Å3 for easy comparison. As a result, it is clear that the void volume is increased by using longer N-donor ligands. Single crystal X-ray analysis revealed that compound 1, [Cu2(H4btp)2(pyr)], crystallizes to form a dense structure in the space group P21/c, which is essentially a different structure from compounds 2–4. All copper(II) ions in compound 1 are crystallographically equivalent and the local coordination geometry around the copper(II) ions is described as a distorted square-pyramidal (Fig. 5a). The copper(II) ions are coordinated by one nitrogen atom and four oxygen atoms, which is the same first coordination environment as those of compounds 2–4. Each copper(II) ion is coordinated by four different phosphonate groups through oxygen atoms and one pyr ligand through a nitrogen atom. Among the bonds, one bond between Cu(1) and O(6) is much longer than the other bonds Fig. 2 View of the asymmetric unit of compound 2.

Compound 1, [Cu2(H4btp)2(pyr)] (pyr = pyrazine), is a dense nonporous 3D framework compound composed of 2D layers bridged through the N-donor ligands pyrazine and phosphonate groups. Compounds 2–4 are topologically identical pillared layered materials, in which the 2D layers are expressed as [Cu2(H2btp)(H2O)2] and different from those in compound 1. The layers are pillared by N-donor ligands giving 3D open framework structures with quasirectangular shaped pores. According to the crystal structures, both the pore size and the pore volume of compounds become larger with longer N-donor ligands. Compounds 2–4 show the reversible structural transformation accompanied by inclusion/removal of guest water molecules. Compounds 2–4 do not show N2 adsorption at 77 K, while they adsorb water vapor at 303 K. It should be noted that compounds 2–4 also adsorb ethanol which is larger in molecular size than N2 and water. In addition, compound 3 adsorbs CO2 molecules at 273 K. The selective adsorption properties of these compounds should be based not on molecular size but on the molecular affinities to the surfaces. Reaction of metal cations and monophosphonic acids generally tends to form layered materials covered with inert organic groups, resulting in stable layered materials with poor reactivities.34–38 Similarly, the use of diphosphonic acids with metal sources often forms dense pillared layered structures, which are composed of alternating inorganic metal phosphonate layers and organic pillar moieties.39–43 The use of tri-functional or higher functional organophosphonic acids has been explored to avoid the formation of such conventional dense pillared layered structures and several groups including us have successfully synthesized metal organophosphonates with unique framework structures and properties.44–52 For example, using tri-functional organophosphonic acid 1,3,5-benzenetriphosphonic acid (BTP = H6btp), we synthesized a layered zinc phosphonate Zn2[C6H3(PO3)2PO3H]·0.5H2bpy·H2O (ZnBP-bpy), which is composed of anionic metal phosphonate layers and protonated 4,4′-bipyridine cations, by a hydrothermal reaction.49 Interestingly, ZnBP-bpy shows a topotactic transformation to a zeolite-like open-framework with selective cation exchange properties.50 Shimizu et al. reported proton conduction via ordered water molecules in a 2D phosphonate MOF with a layered structure closely resembling that of ZnBP-bpy.30 However, such metal organophosphonates with multi-functional †Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: SEM image, TG curves, XRD patterns, CO2 adsorption isotherm, and ethanol adsorption isotherms.

Four N-donor ligands of pyrazine (pyr), 4,4′-bipyridine (bpy), trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)- ethylene (bpe), and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) were selected as the pillar ligands. It is well known that these pillar molecules have potential to expand the interlayer distances of layered materials. Actually, the obtained copper phosphonates have interlayer spaces corresponding to the size of each pillar molecule used and the interlayer distances are in the range 0.9 nm–1.8 nm based on the crystal structures. Although compound 1, [Cu2(H4btp)2(pyr)], is a nonporous material because of the small molecular size of pyr, compounds 2–4, [Cu2(H2btp)(H2O)2(L)] (L = bpy for 2, bpe for 3, and bpp for 4), show porous structures. Compounds 2–4 adsorb and desorb water vapor reversibly with structural transformation. Interestingly, compounds 2–4 adsorb ethanol vapor in spite of no adsorption of N2 molecules, indicating selective adsorption properties based not on molecular size but on the molecular affinities to the surfaces.

As a result it shows negligible N2 and H2 adsorption (Fig. S8 and S9†) indicating the blockage of pores. But surprisingly a water adsorption profile (Fig. 6) was observed for compound 3, which does not adsorb any gas (H2 and N2). Up to P/P0 ∼ 0.60, almost no uptake occurs but after this, a sudden rise leads to a final uptake of 145 mL g−1. The desorption curve creates a huge hysteresis, up to P/P0 ∼ 0.20 almost no release of water molecules was found and then it releases slowly. Such high uptake for this case seems unusual as here the void space content is much less. The explanation can be reached by considering sliding of the nets. Possibly at a certain pressure of water vapour, water molecules undergo efficient interactions with framework which allows the sliding between the nets and thus the void space is created to adsorb the water molecule.

The quenching, reaching λmax at 400 nm half-width <3 s, is faster than recording an emission spectrum, as proven by spectrometer parameters: range 380–650 nm, scan time 0.1 s nm−1, 1 s integration time for the overall spectrum, giving an overall recording time of 28 s. Longer interaction with water does not further change the photoluminescence behaviour (see Fig. 6). This ""turn-off"" effect arises from the hydrolysis of the MOF and thus allows an irreversible detection of water. In contrast to other water-sensitive MOFs, the high speed of the process combined with the observable parameter of luminescence intensity loss renders 1 a suitable detector for water. Irreversible detection of water can, e.g. be especially useful for detection systems that do not allow a reversible change of the detection signal, but instead rely on maintaining the detection grade for longer times. Such examples include water-sensitive pharmaceutical formulations, for which we are currently developing such sensors. For such pharmaceuticals reversible processes would enable possible unwanted re-drying and therefore a wrong detection signal. A wrong outcome of detection could easily happen as such products are not continuously monitored during storage. Accordingly, this kind of detection has to be irreversible.",10.1039/C4DT03578J

The adsorption of water shows a clear uptake step at P/Po = 0.35 and the final value at P/Po = 1.0 corresponds to ten water molecules per formula unit. The observed isotherm indicates that there is a possible adsorption-dependent structural rearrangement, which is attributed to the flexible nature of the framework. In contrast, methanol was adsorbed to a very small value corresponding to one molecule per formula unit. Ethanol in fact did not show any adsorption at all. PXRD profiles of the various resolvated (H2O, MeOH and EtOH) samples show that there is a significant change in patterns for the H2O re-solvated sample. On the other hand, the PXRD profiles of MeOH and EtOH resolvated samples resemble closely that of 3a (Fig. 5 and Fig. S10, ESI†). This could be due to the smaller size of the water molecules, as they can undergo a better diffusion inside the pores than the alcohols and can cause a minor structural deformation.

In the crystal structure, there is a coordinated water molecule which is released at the sample preparation temperature (130 °C) and creates an open metal site in the framework. This open metal site is responsible for the said rise of water uptake at very low pressure. Thereafter, a sharp increase in the vapor adsorption profile was observed which reaches finally up to ∼94 cm3 g−1 which corresponds to around two molecules of H2O per formula unit of 2 (Fig. 6). This moderately high water uptake of 2 is due to the presence of an open metal site in the desolvated form, the presence of a polar azine moiety in the framework and also due to the presence of flexible succinate with an uncoordinated oxygen atom.",10.1039/C5DT03738G

[Fe(pdm)(H2O){Ag(CN)2}2]·H2O<|>1Ag,UKULOB01,Water Stability,Stable,Not Applicable,,"The system does not suffer any noticeable fatigue after repeating several 1$2 cycles. Recovery of the original SCO behavior of 1Ag and 1Au occurs when 2Ag and 2Au are left in air atmosphere. Compounds 1Ag, 1Au, and 2Ag undergo a dramatic change of color from pale yellow (HS state) to deep red (LS state) accompanying the SCO. This thermochromic effect, observed in other 2D and 3D FeII–MII (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) Hofmann-like SCO compounds, is a consequence of the increase in intensity of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band around 550 nm, associated with the electron delocalization from the t2g orbitals of the iron(ii) ion to the p* orbitals of the ligands which is enhanced by the HS!LS spin change. In summary, the coordination polymers 1Au and 1Ag undergo thermally induced first-order, spin-crossover transitions with magnetic and chromatic bistability. They also participate in a controlled and fully reversible crystalline-state ligand substitution, involving coordination/uncoordination of gaseous water and pmd. This induces expansion/contraction of the nanoporous framework and the repeated allosteric transformation of the three interpenetrated nets into a single three-dimensional net (2Ag and 2Au) without affecting their crystallinity but altering their SCO behavior significantly.

lvt-[Cu(Hmpba)2]·9H2O<|>lvt-H2O,DUYSIC,Water Stability,Stable,Not applicable,,"The introduction of linkers with donor groups of stronger basicity such as imidazolates or pyrazolates can thus contribute to markedly increase the stability of MOFs toward water. In metal-azolate frameworks (MAFs), including zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), the metal centers are coordinated by linkers from imidazolate, pyrazolate, triazolate or tetrazolate derivatives. MAFs can show high thermal and chemical stability. In addition, the substituents of the azolate linkers could efficiently tune the hydrophobicity of the framework, contributing to higher kinetic stability against water. MOFs with bifunctional pyrazole-carboxylic acid linkers have been utilized to capture nerve gas agents, as hydrophobic materials for solid-phase extraction, to synthesize MOFs with ordered vacancies and incorporated into mixed-matrix-membranes. If the pyrazole group is not deprotonated during the MOF formation then the pyrazole-carboxylate linker mimics a pyridine-carboxylate linker with the adjacent NH-function as an additional interaction site. The combination of a carboxylate and a pyrazole group in one ligand can give different topological networks based on the same building blocks upon variation of the synthesis conditions. Generally, the product in a MOF-synthesis can vary with solvent, temperature, the metal salt to ligand ratio, the metal counterions and additives. This phenomenon can be exemplified through the three isolated solvent-dependent supramolecular isomers with dia-topology (dia = diamond net) of [Zn(Hmpba)2]·Lsolv with Lsolv = dioxane, ethanol/water, DMF/water, methanol/water and guest-free (non-porous) by using pure water as solvent. In addition, a supramolecular isomer with afw-topology based on the identical tetrahedrally coordinated zinc-knots, but with larger porosity has been synthesized by using toluene as a templating solvent. Besides the arrangement of the same building blocks in the supramolecular isomers with different net topologies, changes in the reaction conditions can also yield a different packing of nets with overall same topologies guided by weak supramolecular interactions. The occurrence of such supramolecular isomers can be an opportunity for better understanding the factors which influence nucleation and crystal growth, because at the moment little is known on the controlling factors of such supramolecular isomers, except that the probability for the formation of supramolecular isomers increases in structures with flexible parts and ligands with functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report the 2D nets sql-[Cu(Hmpba)2]·xDMF and sql-[Cu(Hmpba)2]·2ACN, which are two crystallographically distinct supramolecular isomers to the known 3D net lvt-[Cu(Hmpba)2]·4MeOH·1H2O (lvt-MeOH), synthesized by Richardson and co-workers (lvt is a 42.84 net). We examined both supramolecular isomers regarding their vapor and gas sorption properties, thereby highlighting the seemingly important role of the N–H donor function of the pyrazolemoiety. In addition, we were able to obtain a 3D lvt-H2O net by replacing the solvent in lvt-MeOH with water. The bifunctional linker 4-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (H2mpba) was used for the synthesis of new (square lattice) sql 2D metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [Cu(Hmpba)2]·L (L = DMF or ACN) in a solvent-mixture of dimethylformamide/water and acetonitrile/water. These sql 2D MOFs are supramolecular isomers of the lvt 3D network [Cu(Hmpba)2]·4MeOH·1H2O (lvt-MeOH) that was synthesized previously by Richardson and co-workers. All these frameworks are potentially porous structures with solvent molecules included in the channels of the as synthesized materials. After activation all three materials showed good CO2 adsorption capacity, demonstrated here for lvt-MeOH for the first time, with a saturation uptake of 113 cm3 g−1 (lvt-MeOH-act.), 111 cm3 g−1 (sql-DMF-act.) and 90 cm3 g−1 (sqlACN-act.) at 195 K. The flexibility of the lvt-MeOH-act. network is evidenced by a gate-opening effect seen in the CO2 measurement at 195 K and under gravimetric high-pressure CO2 adsorption. According to the water and ethanol sorption measurements the new sql frameworks can be categorized as hydrophobic materials in contrast to the hydrophilic lvt framework. In the lvt-MeOH structure the crystal solvent can be replaced with water to yield the structurally authenticated water-only network lvt-H2O containing 3D arrays of S4-symmetric (H2O)20 clusters. The isosteric enthalpy of adsorption at zero coverage, ΔH°ads for CO2 and CH4 from adsorption isotherms at 273–293 K was calculated with the virial fit method. As expected, the values of the isosteric enthalpy of adsorption for CO2 are significantly higher than for CH4 for all three materials. At the same time, the magnitude of the isosteric enthalpy for CO2 for the lvtMeOH network is relatively high with −41 kJ mol−1 compared to other MOFs (typical range between 21–39 kJ mol−1). The still present water molecule in lvt-MeOH is seen as the basis for the high isosteric enthalpy. In contrast, ΔH°ads for CO2 in both sql-networks is at the lower end of the typical range. To classify the sql and lvt structures in terms of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, water and ethanol sorption measurements were carried out and the Henry constants were determined. The activated sql-DMF network (sql-DMF-act.) was used exemplarily because of the better pore accessibility over the sql-ACN network (which was evident from CO2 sorption). For sql-DMF-act. the water uptake at high P/P0 > 0.4 and a Henry constant value in the order of 10−7 g mol−1 Pa−1 corresponds to a hydrophobic character of the pores. On the other hand, the early water uptake below P/P0 = 0.1 and a Henry constant of 10−5 g mol−1 Pa−1 for lvt-MeOH-act. indicates a rather hydrophilic material. At the adsorption maximum (P/P0 = 0.9) the lvt-MeOH-act. structure has adsorbed 2.8 water molecules per formula unit (5.7 mmol g−1). Together with the residual 1.5 water molecules, the structure then contains 4.3 water molecules per formula unit. This agrees well with the 4.5 water molecules found in the crystal structure of the water exchanged lvt-H2O material. The isosteric enthalpy of water adsorption for the sql-DMFact. material increases with the water uptake from −32 to −50 kJ mol−1, which is only slightly above the evaporation enthalpy of water (44 kJ mol−1). In contrast, ΔHads for the activated lvt-MeOH increases from −41 to −64 kJ mol−1, which underlines the hydrophilicity of the material. For the initial increase in ΔHads for the hydrophobic sql-DMF a framework flexibility or phase change may be proposed, through which anchor points could be formed for the subsequent (increasing) adsorption of water. Such a flexibility or phase change induced by the first water molecules at high P/P0 in sql-DMF could make the –NH groups of the Hmpba− ligand available as H-bond donor sites. For lvt-MeOH the initial increase in ΔHads is proposed to be due to a similar gate-opening effect as for the CO2 adsorption. The isotherm of the ethanol sorption at 293 K corroborates the flexibility of the lvt-network by showing a sudden opening at P/ P0 ≈ 0.1 with a Type F-II isotherm. For the sql-network the ethanol adsorption isotherm at 293 K shows a gradual increase. In this contribution we present two new microporous 2D metal–organic frameworks sql-[Cu(Hmpba)2]·xDMF and sql- [Cu(Hmpba)2]·2ACN which are based on the linear, bifunctional 4-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzoate linker in its monodeprotonated form Hmpba−. The microporous character of the two activated MOFs was demonstrated by CO2 and CH4 sorption. The 2D MOFs are supramolecular isomers of already known 3D lvt-Cu frameworks [Cu(Hmpba)2]·Lsolv. Through a methanol-to-water solvent exchange we could derive from lvt-[Cu(Hmpba)2]·4MeOH·1H2O at the new all-water isomer 3D lvt-[Cu(Hmpba)2]·9H2O, with a water substructure of a 3D array of S4-symmetric (H2O)20 clusters. The potential porosity of the lvt-[Cu(Hmpba)2] isomers had not been described before and here we showed for the first time that the 3D network lvt-[Cu(Hmpba)2]·4MeOH·1H2O could be activated for CO2 and CH4 adsorption in with it displays a gate-opening effect. A crucial structural difference between the supramolecular sqland lvt-[Cu(Hmpba)2] isomers is the engagement of the –NH group of the pyrazolyl moiety in inter-network H-bonding in the former and in crystal-water H-bonding in the latter. This difference then leads to a hydrophobic character of the sql-materials and a hydrophilic lvt-network, which was demonstrated here by water and ethanol sorption through their isotherm shape, relative uptake pressure and isosteric enthalpy of adsorption. The [M(Hmpba)2]·solvent materials reported here are relatively rare examples of supramolecular framework isomers where subtle changes in H-bonding around metal centers result in substantial changes in structure and sorption properties. The combination of the heteroditopic approach in combination with different synthetic conditions (solvent templating) are the reason for these different isomers. There are no conflicts to declare. described with a central (H2O)12 unit composed of four 7-membered rings, onto which four 4-membered rings are annelated. The H-bridged O⋯O contacts vary between 2.7 and 3.1 Å. Such higher dimensionality water clusters are rare. A 1D water chain containing (H2O)20 was reported in the 2D framework [Cd(phen)2(male)(H2O)]·9.5H2O (male2− = maleate) and a regular pentagonal (H2O)20 dodecahedra in the 2D network [Ag6(Pra2biim)3]·5.33H2O (Pra2biim2− = 1,1′-di (propionate)-2,2′-biimidazole) Theoretical calculations for (H2O)20 clusters looked at structures of annelated 4- to 6-membered rings. Other large water clusters include, for example, a (H2O)14 cluster of S6 symmetry, a (H2O)12-containing infinite chain, one-dimensional water helices, 2D-water/ice layers with (H2O)8 subunits and a three dimensional open framework. Comparison between sql-[Cu(Hmpba)2] and lvt-[Cu(Hmpba)2] networks The 2D networks in sql-DMF and sql-ACN are supramolecular isomers to the 3D frameworks of lvt-MeOH and lvt-H2O. In the sql structure the {CuO2N2} SBUs and the bonding directions of the linkers of a single network all lie in one plane. The angle between the {CuO2N2} planes is 19°. In the lvt structures a 3D connectivity is brought about by the tilting of the adjacent {CuO2N2} planes by 74°. The interplanar phenyl–pyrazole angle is similar in the sql and the lvt networks with 51.7(3)° and 47.6(4)°, respectively. The difference between the 2D sql-networks and the 3D lvtnetworks can be traced to the templating effect by the solvent of crystallization. The sql isomers have DMF and ACN incorporated into the structure. Subsequently, the N–H group seeks an acceptor in the network building blocks and becomes engaged into interlayer N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds to a carboxylate group from the adjacent layer.

As shown in Fig. S7,† the N2 sorption of CoMOF1-tpt at 77 K affords a type I isotherm, indicating the permanent microporosity of the framework. The Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of Co-MOF1-tpt is calculated to be 826 m2 g−1 and the Langmuir surface area is about 1119 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of the Co-MOF1 (the BET surface of Co-MOF1 is 15 m2 g−1). Although the porosity of the Co-MOF1-tpt is slightly reduced compared to that of Co-MOF1, due to the presence of an additional tpt ligand, its surface area has increased by about fifty-five times. Moreover, the selective CO2 sorption properties of Co-MOF1-tpt were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 3a, the CO2 uptake of Co-MOF1tpt reaches 4.38 mmol g−1 (98.17 cm3 g−1) at 273 K and 2.84 mmol g−1 (63.68 cm3 g−1) at 298 K under 1 atm, and the initial isosteric heat of sorption (Qst) estimated using the virial method is about 27.6 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 3b and S8, ESI†).17 Comparing with the gas sorption performances of CPM-33a with similar structures,13b the CO2 gas uptake of Co-MOF1-tpt is slightly lower under the same conditions, while the Qst shows a significant increase. The relatively high Qst observed in CoMOF1-tpt indicates a stronger interaction between the framework and the CO2 molecules compared with that in CPM-33a, which might be attributed to the strong basicity of the triazole functional groups in cpt and the local electric field induced by the asymmetric trinuclear SBUs.11,12 Furthermore, the CH4 adsorptions of Co-MOF1-tpt have also been performed to evaluate its potential in CO2/CH4 separation applications.18 Under the same conditions, the material shows a lower CH4 adsorption amount and adsorption heat than CO2 (inset of Fig. 3), and the selectivity predicted using the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)19 reaches about 11.5 at 273 K and low pressure, while a decreased trend was observed upon increasing the pressure (9.5 at 120 kPa).

A behaviour that has been referred to as pseudo-isomorphism.21,22 The lithium ion coordinates with five oxygen atoms forming a distorted trigonal bipyramid while the sodium salt with six oxygen atoms in an octahedral manner (Fig. 2). In both cases, IOR chelates the metal atoms with one carboxylate and one keto oxygen. Two of such complexes from a dimer with the carboxylate oxygen bridging between two metals [{M2(IOR-kO,mO)2}]. Above and below the plane of the dimer, two water molecules link the dimers into a 1D polymer (ladder). Such arrangement ensures the p stacking of the aromatic rings. In NaIORH2O the distorted octahedral coordination sphere is completed by a further interaction with the carboxylate oxygen from the IOR below in the same polymeric chain: O–Na distance = 2.47 Å. In LiIOR H2O such interaction is absent: O–Li distance 3.68 Å. Therefore, the resulting underlying net topology is 2,3,5C2 and 2,2,4C1 for sodium and lithium respectively.

Ultimately, in the lithium complex, the metal ions lay almost in the plane common to the aromatic rings (about 0.08 Å). In the sodium complex, such distance increases to about 0.45 Å.

Each set of equal ligands is bound in a meridional fashion. Methanetrisulfonic acid shows a variety of coordination modes, depending on the nature of the cation.

The dehydrated sample was kept under the flow of moist N2 for 90 min to re-adsorb the water molecules. A gain of approximately 3.8% from the dehydrated weight of approximately 92.9% was observed during this process, which corresponds to an uptake of approximately three moles of water molecules per mole of I (Figure S9). The same experiment was repeated four times, which resulted in reproducible behavior. A water sorption study on the desolvated compound I a was also performed to investigate the nature of water uptake using a BELSORP Aqua instrument. The water sorption isotherm (298 K) showed a gradual uptake of water with adsorption values of 120 mLg ¢1at a partial pressure p/p0 of 0.9 (Figure 3 a).

2. The reversibility of water adsorption was further examined by using an in situ diffuse reflectance IR spectroscopic (DRIFTS) study in the temperature range 30–120 8C (Figure S6 a). As is apparent, the O¢H bond stretch of lattice water molecules at approximately 3540 cm¢1 gradually disappears as the temperature is raised from 30 to 120 8C.

In addition, the intensities of the asymmetric/symmetric stretching of the N¢H band of the free amine groups (3374/3175 cm¢1) and the O¢H band of the H3O +ion (3456/3356 cm¢1) also decreases, suggesting changes within the structure because of the disruption to the hydrogen-bond interactions. Similar behavior has been observed previously.

3. On rehydration, the broad band corresponding to the O¢H stretching of the lattice water molecules reappears, confirming the reuptake of the water molecules (Figure S7b).

[CdII(H2O)2][CuII(mal)2(H2O)2]n<|>compound 1,GURZID,Water Stability,Stable,,,The compound shows reversible water absorption which correlates very well with the crystal structure. Further study in this line continues in our laboratory to explore this novel approach of producing porous materials. The water loss/gain is reversible and this is expected from the structure of the 3D framework as water not only fills the void spaces but simultaneously acts to saturate the metal centers coordinatively. The crystalline nature of the compound 1 was lost when it was heated in an air-oven at 240(±2)°C for completion of the dehydration process. The XPRD pattern of the dehydrated material reveals that it is amorphous in nature while the XRPD patterns of compound 1 and rehydrated compound 1 are strikingly similar with that of the simulated XRPD pattern of compound 1. These observations further support that the water loss/gain process is reversible and the crystalline nature of the compound 1 could be reversibly regenerated. Thus we conclude that the compound 1 upon dehydration and rehydration transforms from crystalline state to amorphous state and then back to crystalline state again.,10.1016/j.ica.2009.12.026

Unfortunately it has been proven here that this solid cannot be thermally activated because it decomposes upon heating. These experiments clearly demonstrate that the molecular network is irreversibly destroyed at very low temperature upon heating.

PXRD patterns of the sample soaked in the acidic water solution (pH 13) demonstrates broadening of the peaks and the decrease of their intensity. This effect could be attributed to the beginning of partial decomposition of the framework under these conditions. In contrast, PXRD patterns of samples treated in acidic media do not lose their quality. This effect could be explained by the presence of H-bond interactions between the guest protonated water molecules and CH-groups of furan cycle, which additionally increases the framework’s rigidity. Such an impressive hydrolytic stability of compound 3 is rare among the MOF materials.",10.1016/j.poly.2018.01.031

Na(HO3PC12H8PO3H2)<|>compound 2,WAPYOD,Water Stability,Unstable,,,"The sodium compound (2) has an edge-shared bioctahedral Na2O10 motif, formed from 10 different phosphonate moieties. Each sodium atom in the Na2O10 unit is six-coordinate and bonded to six different phosphonate moieties, thus no chelation is observed. The oxygen atom O6 does not bond to any metal atoms, instead it forms hydrogen bonds to O2–H and O3–H. Each octahedron shares one edge (O5 and O5D) resulting in the edge-shared bioctahedral, Na2O10, which is corner-connected to eight symmetry equivalent bioctahedra, together forming an inorganic layer in the ab-plane. The layers stacked along the c-axis, have an interlayer distance of 14.94Å. Each inorganic layer has alternating four- and eight-membered rings along the b-axis. The diphosphonates, in 2, cross-links the inorganic layer together forming a regular pillared structure. Interestingly, neighboring pillars along the ab-diagonal are rotated 54° from each other presumably to reduce strain caused by close contacts from other neighboring pillars. Noteworthy, the potential C–H..π distances (shortest C-H..π 3.696Å, 127°C) are longer than the van der Waals radii.",10.1016/j.jssc.2011.12.034

Surprisingly, being evidenced by IR, elemental analysis, X-ray crystal diffraction and PXRD, the rehydrated 1′ is identical to 1. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction of 1′ reveals that the crystal retains the monoclinic crystal system and the P21/c space group, with the same unit cell parameters (Table S1). The bond lengths between metal central and coordinated atoms are almost equal and the bond angles is similar to compound 1 (Table S2). Additionally, a comparison of PXRD pattern of 1′ with the simulated one from single-crystal data of 1 is shown in Fig. S3. The results indicate that the hydrated form 1′ shows the same phase compared with 1. Additionally, we also investigated the recyclability of the rehydration/hydration process (Fig. 12). We employed a modified TGA setup containing a port for introducing the water vapor. The sample was heated to temperature of complete dehydration in N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 5°Cmin−1 by using the TGA crucible. The sample was slowly cooled to room temperature (1°C/min) and saturated water vapor was introduced into the system for rehydration about 120min. Through this strategy, we obviously found that samples reached close to the original weights after reabsorbing the water molecules: the initial weight of 99.8% and the dehydrated weight of 99.1%. Complete absorption of water molecules was observed when the samples were exposed to atmospheric conditions for a longer duration. A PXRD investigation on the hydrated and rehydrated samples also confirmed that the integrity of the samples was maintained (Fig. 13). This process of dehydration/rehydration was repeated two cycles to evidence the reversibility of the process.",10.1016/j.jssc.2013.10.022

Similar results were obtained for the Mn compound [28]. From these investigations it can be assumed that the hydration and dehydration process occurs via a topotactic reaction. This assumption is supported by additional investigations using single crystal X-ray experiments. Two complete data sets were measured for a freshly prepared single crystal of the Ni compound and after this crystal was suspended to vacuum for some time. The reflections of the partially hydrated phase can be indexed successfully yielding the same monoclinic metric as for the starting compound with only slight changes in the lattice parameters. The habit of the crystal does not change and only a broadening of some reflections is observed. In addition, we have determined the single crystal structure of all compounds for crystals which were stored in a silica gel filled glassy container so that a part of the channel water molecules was removed in the crystals. All structures could be refined successfully and the positions of the water molecules are only partially occupied and some disordering is present. In addition, the deintercalation of the channel water molecules leads to small but significant changes in the metal coordination and especially of the hydrogen bonds.",10.1016/S0022-4596(03)00306-2
