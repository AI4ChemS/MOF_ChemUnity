2. ""The ability of these materials to capture CO2 from wet flue gases is of important practical concern. We therefore used a breakthrough experiment to determine the capture capacity of both Al-PMOF and Al-PyrMOF for a mixture of CO2/N2 under dry- and humid-conditions24 (Fig. 4e). These results confirm the predictions of the simulations (Extended Data Fig. 7): humidity in the flue gases has only a minimal influence on the capture capacity of Al-PMOF, whereas for Al-Pyr- MOF the capture capacity is in fact enhanced.""",10.1038/s41586-019-1798-7

89,[Ag(L424)(CF 3COO)](H 2O) (1*CF3COO),HELLOW,Water Stability,Stable,N/A,,"Colorless crystals of 1NO3 were harvested by layered diffusion of L424 in methanol and AgNO3 in water. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1NO3 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I41/a. Each AgI ion adopts a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 1a), defined by three nitrogen atoms from three independent L424 ligands (Ag–N: 2.235(3)–2.358(3) Å) and one oxygen atom from water (Ag–O: 2.414(4) Å). The L424 ligand acts as the tridentate linker to bridge three AgI ions via two 4-pyridyl and one 2-pyridyl groups (Fig. S1a, ESI‡). The three pyridyl rings in the L424 ligand are twisted from the central triazolyl plane with dihedral angles of 30.5(1), 71.7(1), and 32.4(1)1, respectively. As a result, the AgI ions are extended by L424 ligands to generate a 3D open framework (Fig. S2a, ESI‡) with 3-connected lvt-a topology. Further, three such open nets are entangled with each other to construct a 3-fold interpenetrated host framework (Fig. 1b and c), in which the guest nitrate anions are located. A prominent structural feature of 1*NO3 is the presence of helical motifs in virtue of the crystallographic requirement for I41/a symmetry (Fig. S2b, ESI‡). The Ag(I) centers are linked by two 4-pyridyl groups of L424 to form a 1D Ag–L424 helical chain, which runs along the 43 screw axis in the c direction with a pitch of 23.540(4) Å. The length of the pitch is equal to that of a triple c axis, which allows 43-helices with the same chirality in a 3-fold entangled fashion separated by a single c axis length (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, each 3-fold 43-helix is locked by four other ones with the opposite chirality via additional Ag–N2-pyridyl interactions. In 1NO3, the nitrate anions are located in the voids of the host framework as lattice guests, so the possibility that nitrate can be replaced by other anions was probed. The anion-exchange performance of 1NO3 was illustrated by using NO2 and CF3COO as the models. Since crystalline 1NO3 is stable in water and organic solvents, we selected the appropriate single crystals of 1NO3 with similar shapes and sizes, and immersed them in a water solution of NaNO2 or NaCF3COO for anion-exchange (Fig. S3, ESI‡). Notably, the crystal morphology can be well retained during this procedure, indicating a SC–SC transformation.

90,[Ag(L424)(NO 2)](H 2O)1.5(1*NO 2),HELLOW,Water Stability,Stable,N/A,,"Colorless crystals of 1NO3 were harvested by layered diffusion of L424 in methanol and AgNO3 in water. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1NO3 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I41/a. Each AgI ion adopts a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 1a), defined by three nitrogen atoms from three independent L424 ligands (Ag–N: 2.235(3)–2.358(3) Å) and one oxygen atom from water (Ag–O: 2.414(4) Å). The L424 ligand acts as the tridentate linker to bridge three AgI ions via two 4-pyridyl and one 2-pyridyl groups (Fig. S1a, ESI‡). The three pyridyl rings in the L424 ligand are twisted from the central triazolyl plane with dihedral angles of 30.5(1), 71.7(1), and 32.4(1)1, respectively. As a result, the AgI ions are extended by L424 ligands to generate a 3D open framework (Fig. S2a, ESI‡) with 3-connected lvt-a topology. Further, three such open nets are entangled with each other to construct a 3-fold interpenetrated host framework (Fig. 1b and c), in which the guest nitrate anions are located. A prominent structural feature of 1*NO3 is the presence of helical motifs in virtue of the crystallographic requirement for I41/a symmetry (Fig. S2b, ESI‡). The Ag(I) centers are linked by two 4-pyridyl groups of L424 to form a 1D Ag–L424 helical chain, which runs along the 43 screw axis in the c direction with a pitch of 23.540(4) Å. The length of the pitch is equal to that of a triple c axis, which allows 43-helices with the same chirality in a 3-fold entangled fashion separated by a single c axis length (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, each 3-fold 43-helix is locked by four other ones with the opposite chirality via additional Ag–N2-pyridyl interactions. In 1NO3, the nitrate anions are located in the voids of the host framework as lattice guests, so the possibility that nitrate can be replaced by other anions was probed. The anion-exchange performance of 1NO3 was illustrated by using NO2 and CF3COO as the models. Since crystalline 1NO3 is stable in water and organic solvents, we selected the appropriate single crystals of 1NO3 with similar shapes and sizes, and immersed them in a water solution of NaNO2 or NaCF3COO for anion-exchange (Fig. S3, ESI‡). Notably, the crystal morphology can be well retained during this procedure, indicating a SC–SC transformation. The resulting colorless crystals of 1NO2 or 1CF3COO were analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and the anion-exchange products were also confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Fig. 2) and IR (Fig. S4, ESI‡). For 1NO2, the unit cell and space group of crystals are quite similar to those for 1NO3. As a result, the topological network and 3-fold interpenetrated framework are maintained (Fig. S5, ESI‡). The structural difference is only that the NO2 anion is coordinated to AgIin a chelating mode, and the coordination geometry of the AgI center becomes a distorted square-pyramid (t = 0.21).15 The L424 ligand has a slight conformational change, in which the three pyridyl groups are twisted from the central triazolyl ring by the dihedral angles of 35.7(1), 69.7(1), and 32.9(1)1, respectively. Accordingly, the characteristic peak of NO3 (1385 cm1) in the IR spectrum of 1NO3 disappears, and the IR absorption band of NO2 is observed at 1270 cm1 for the anion-exchange product 1NO2 (Fig. S4, ESI‡).

Featuring research from the group of Professor Miao Du at College of Chemistry, Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China Dual structure evolution of a Ag(I) supramolecular framework triggered by anion-exchange: replacement of terminal ligand and switching of network interpenetration degree Single-crystal to single-crystal transformations driven by distinct anion-exchange procedures can be achieved for a 3-fold interpenetrated Ag(I) supramolecular framework. The dual structure evolution will lead to the straightforward replacement of terminal ligand around Ag(I) or drastic lattice reorganization for switching of network interpenetration degree (from 3-fold to 2-fold).

The mechanism proposed for the crystal conversion could be appropriately interpreted by contraction analysis of the helical chains. In 1NO3 and 1NO2, the pitches of the 43-helices are ca. 24 Å, being three times the length of the c axis. As for 1CF3COO, the pitch of the 42-helix is ca. 16 Å, being two times the length of the c axis. In order to make this transformation more clear, we select a length of 48 Å in the Ag–L424 helical chains, which contains approximately two or three periods for 1NO3/1NO2 or 1CF3COO, respectively (Fig. 4a). Notably, the torsion angle of Ag–Ag–Ag represents a critical parameter to specify such helical chains. In the SC–SC transformation from 1NO3 to 1NO2, the helical chains show negligible distortions and also, the torsion angles are almost unchanged (63.001 vs. 63.491). Thus, the 3-fold interpenetrated framework will be retained. In contrast, the exchange of NO3 by CF3COO leads to a drastic contraction of the helical chains in 1*CF3COO, as reflected by the obviously acute Ag–Ag–Ag torsion angle (41.891). Correspondingly, the length of 48 Å is suitable for three independent helical chains arranged in the interpenetrated patterns for 1NO3 or 1NO2, whereas for 1CF3COO, only 2-fold helical arrays are properly accommodated therein. Also, the 1CF3COO network shows a shrinkage trend in comparison with 1NO3 or 1NO2 (Fig. 4b). In short, the contraction of Ag–L424 helical chains is concomitant with the anion-exchange process of NO3 by CF3COO, and the 3-fold entangled motif is transformed into its 2-fold interpenetrated analogue, which can be vividly illustrated by a simulation video (see Video S1, ESI‡). The driving force for these structural transformations can be rationalized as the synergic influence of coordination capability, concentration, and steric effect of the anions. A general trend from strongly to weakly coordinating anions was established in an order of NO2 4 NO3 4 CF3COO. 16 On one hand, regarding the transformation from 1NO3 to 1NO2, the lattice NO3 anions can be easily exchanged by NO2 anions in virtue of the stronger coordination ability and higher concentration of NO2 anions. Also, the similar volumes for NO2 and NO3 are anticipated to afford the same 3-fold interpenetrated frameworks of 1NO3 and 1NO2. On the other hand, though the CF3COO anion shows weaker binding ability to AgI, the higher anion concentration of CF3COO is expected to tolerate the conversion from 1NO3 to 1CF3COO. Moreover, the significant volume difference between the two anions results in the framework shrinkage from 1NO3 to 1CF3COO, also facilitating the variation of interpenetration degree of networks from 3-fold to 2-fold. In summary, this work presents the first paradigm for modulation of the network interpenetration degrees via SC–SC transformation driven by anion-exchange. Actually, anion-exchange always makes single crystals unable to survive substantial rearrangement during conversions and difficult to structurally analyse. A mechanism of such anion-exchange ability between the supramolecular systems 1NO3 and 1NO2 or 1CF3COO can be properly elucidated as a concerted evolution of breakage or recovery of Fig. 3 Crystal structure of 1CF3COO.

Reactions in the solid state, particularly single-crystal to single-crystal (SC–SC) transformations, have become important in obtaining targeted coordination frameworks with desired properties.1 Such dynamic processes essentially rely on the flexibility of coordination networks constructed by coordination bonding and secondary interactions.2 In these cases, the parent crystals may undergo various structural transformations in response to external stimuli (e.g. the most common is solvent exchange or removal),3 which have shown potential applications in sensing, guest capture, and switch.4 Notably, drastic rearrangements of molecular components in the crystals sometimes occur, involving the formation and breakage of intermolecular interactions, as well as network rotation, bending, swinging, sliding, shrinking, or swelling.5 Monitoring such structural transformations is always challenging, but fortunately, the structural information at the initial and final states can be obtained benefiting from the significant progress in single-crystal X-ray crystallography.6 In this context, the anion guests in the coordination assembly can not only regulate the electrovalence of host networks but also act as the template to modulate the SC–SC transformations. In contrast to solvents, anions in crystals are replaceable but not removable for SC–SC transformations. Normally, anion-directed structural transformations need more rigorous reaction conditions to facilitate the change of covalent or noncovalent interactions for anion insertion and removal, which however will go against the stabilization of host networks and retention of their crystalline state.7 Moreover, most anions have high free hydration energies and thus are not easy to bind and extract from water.8 Interpenetration is a common phenomenon in coordination networks, which can be considered as the polymeric analogues of catenanes or rotaxanes.9 A highly interpenetrated architecture may have a relatively higher thermal stability but a lower free volume, favoring selective molecular recognition and separation.10 In contrast, a non-interpenetrated structure has a higher free volume yet a relatively lower thermal stability, in favor of energy source storage and catalysis.11 Conceptually, interpenetrated supramolecular motifs with different degrees of interpenetration and their non-interpenetrated counterparts can be deemed specific network stereoisomers. Though such network-catenation isomerism is hardly anticipated, some examples of controlling the network interpenetration have been successfully achieved by ligand design and rationalizing the reaction parameters (e.g. temperature, concentration, template, and solvent).12 Notably, two or more interpenetrated frameworks cannot be separated without breaking the chemical bonds in an individual network. In reality, alteration of the degrees of n-fold (n Z 2) interpenetration for coordination networks via SC–SC transformation has rarely been explored with only three known examples thus far. Chen et al.reported a pair of [Ag6Cl(atz)4]OHxH2O (atz = aminotriazolates) coordination networks, as the 5-fold and 6-fold interpenetrated isomers, between which SC–SC transformation reversibly occurs upon dehydration or hydration.13 Barbour et al. revealed the SC–SC transformation from 2-fold to 3-fold interpenetrated net isomers for [Zn2(ndc)2(bpy)]solvent14a or [Co2(ndc)2(bpy)]-solvent14b by desolvation (ndc = naphthalene-dicarboxylate and bpy = 4,40-bipyridine). Interestingly, a guest-free 2-fold interpenetrated intermediate can be isolated in the latter case. In such courses, deconstruction and reconstruction of coordination bonding and the whole network result in the alteration of interpenetration numbers by the shift of adjacent connections.

91,[Ag(L424)(H 2O)](NO 3)(1*NO 3),HELLOW,Water Stability,Stable,N/A,,"Colorless crystals of 1NO3 were harvested by layered diffusion of L424 in methanol and AgNO3 in water. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that 1NO3 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I41/a. Each AgI ion adopts a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 1a), defined by three nitrogen atoms from three independent L424 ligands (Ag–N: 2.235(3)–2.358(3) Å) and one oxygen atom from water (Ag–O: 2.414(4) Å). The L424 ligand acts as the tridentate linker to bridge three AgI ions via two 4-pyridyl and one 2-pyridyl groups (Fig. S1a, ESI‡). The three pyridyl rings in the L424 ligand are twisted from the central triazolyl plane with dihedral angles of 30.5(1), 71.7(1), and 32.4(1)1, respectively. As a result, the AgI ions are extended by L424 ligands to generate a 3D open framework (Fig. S2a, ESI‡) with 3-connected lvt-a topology. Further, three such open nets are entangled with each other to construct a 3-fold interpenetrated host framework (Fig. 1b and c), in which the guest nitrate anions are located. A prominent structural feature of 1*NO3 is the presence of helical motifs in virtue of the crystallographic requirement for I41/a symmetry (Fig. S2b, ESI‡). The Ag(I) centers are linked by two 4-pyridyl groups of L424 to form a 1D Ag–L424 helical chain, which runs along the 43 screw axis in the c direction with a pitch of 23.540(4) Å. The length of the pitch is equal to that of a triple c axis, which allows 43-helices with the same chirality in a 3-fold entangled fashion separated by a single c axis length (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, each 3-fold 43-helix is locked by four other ones with the opposite chirality via additional Ag–N2-pyridyl interactions. In 1NO3, the nitrate anions are located in the voids of the host framework as lattice guests, so the possibility that nitrate can be replaced by other anions was probed. The anion-exchange performance of 1NO3 was illustrated by using NO2 and CF3COO as the models. Since crystalline 1NO3 is stable in water and organic solvents, we selected the appropriate single crystals of 1NO3 with similar shapes and sizes, and immersed them in a water solution of NaNO2 or NaCF3COO for anion-exchange (Fig. S3, ESI‡). Notably, the crystal morphology can be well retained during this procedure, indicating a SC–SC transformation. The resulting colorless crystals of 1NO2 or 1CF3COO were analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and the anion-exchange products were also confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Fig. 2) and IR (Fig. S4, ESI‡). For 1NO2, the unit cell and space group of crystals are quite similar to those for 1NO3. As a result, the topological network and 3-fold interpenetrated framework are maintained (Fig. S5, ESI‡). The structural difference is only that the NO2 anion is coordinated to AgIin a chelating mode, and the coordination geometry of the AgI center becomes a distorted square-pyramid (t = 0.21).15 The L424 ligand has a slight conformational change, in which the three pyridyl groups are twisted from the central triazolyl ring by the dihedral angles of 35.7(1), 69.7(1), and 32.9(1)1, respectively. Accordingly, the characteristic peak of NO3 (1385 cm1) in the IR spectrum of 1NO3 disappears, and the IR absorption band of NO2 is observed at 1270 cm1 for the anion-exchange product 1NO2 (Fig. S4, ESI‡).",10.1039/c6cc05938d

Thus, the rehydration process is accompanied by return of the original blue color. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination of 3 revealed that the crystal system and space group remain the same as those of 2, but the copper center has re-form from a square planar (as in 2) to an octahedral coordination environment, owing to the introduction of coordinated water molecules. It is worth mentioning that on rehydration the two closely packed interpenetrating networks undergo stress relax, which is due to the expansion of the channel size (5.72 Å) to provide a void space composing 31.3% of the total crystal volume. The TG profile of 3 also exhibits a stepwise release and shows that all the coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules are lost at 80 °C (calcd, 10.0%; found, 9.8%) (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Thus, heating 3 to 110 °C for 2 h completely reverses the structural change, and the original material 2 is reconstituted after the removal of all the water molecules.

Despite its microporous structure adsorption occurs not until p/p0 = 0.4 revealing the hydrophobic character of the pores. As all aluminium ions are coordinated to oxygen atoms, there are no free coordination sites available. Additionally, the character of the non-polar, aromatic naphthalene linkers connecting the alumina-oxygen chains is highly hydrophobic. In the higher pressure region, additional adsorption occurs which is the result of condensation of water in the pores. Surprisingly, the experiment shows the opposite behavior of hysteresis. The desorption branch falls below the adsorption branch. We assume that this is due to partial decomposition of the framework during adsorption in the higher pressure region resulting in a higher water uptake. This water is then desorbed from a new solid phase with different water-surface interaction of lower binding strength leading to the steep decline of the desorption isotherm. A second measurement of the water sorption isotherms on the same sample confirmed this assumption as it revealed a similar shape of the isotherm, but the isotherms can not be superimposed. To analyze the water stability, the material was heated in water at 323 K for 24 h. The XRD powder pattern (Fig. S3) confirmed the partial decomposition of DUT-4, since the reflections are partly shifted and the amorphous background increased.

Before each measurement, CH3MOF-5-4d and DiCH3MOF-5-4d were reactivated by heating the samples at 160 1C in vacuum for 24 h. The hydrogen uptake capacity of CH3MOF-5 is reduced to 70% after 4 days exposure to ambient air, whereas the hydrogen uptake capacity of DiCH3MOF-5-4d remains virtually the same. These results, again, imply that methyl substituents can play an important role in designing water-stable MOFs without compromising the hydrogen uptake capacity. The obtained results suggest that by simply introducing methyl groups the hydrogen uptake capacity of MOF-5 remains uncompromised and less sensitive to the presence of moisture, even after 4 days exposure to air with a relative humidity of 32–37%. The methyl and 2,5-dimethyl MOF-5 analogs were synthesized using a well-known solvothermal route. The samples were activated by immersing them in dried CHCl3 followed by heating at 160 1C in vacuum for 24 h. The samples thus obtained were denoted as CH3MOF-5 and DiCH3MOF-5. According to the C and H elemental analysis results in Table 1, the H content in reactivated CH3MOF-5-4d is higher than that of a fresh sample, which is due to the absorbed water and corresponds to a water content of about 3.2 wt%. This CH3MOF-5, with strongly adsorbed water, shows a lower H2 uptake capacity as compared to a fresh sample. Although the structure of CH3MOF-5 remains stable at low water concentrations, distortions in the framework structure might occur as reported in a simulated study for MOF-5. Even 0.6 wt% of water in the structure may lead to the distortion of the ZnO4 tetrahedron and this will result in a reduced hydrogen uptake capability. Introducing a second methyl group, as is the case for DiCH3MOF-5, the water uptake is reduced even further, which can be concluded from the constant C/H ratio found for DiCH3MOF-5 and DiCH3MOF-5-4d. This result confirms that incorporating hydrophobic methyl groups can indeed improve the water stability of MOF-5 without seriously compromising the hydrogen uptake capability. Even after a total of 8 days exposure to ambient air, the original structures of CH3MOF-5 and DiCH3MOF-5 are still maintained according to the PXRD patterns (see Fig. S3, ESIw). About 65% of the hydrogen uptake capacities of CH3MOF-5 and DiCH3MOF-5 could be retained (Fig. S4, ESIw).

More specifically, a sharp increase in uptake at 30% RH followed by a decrease from 40 to 60% RH. In this case, the loss of adsorbed water despite increasing water vapor concentration is likely an attribute of both the structure loss of the adsorbent itself and the hydrophobic properties of the degradation product, DABCO. 
2. The significant loss of crystallinity in the DMOF-1 materials is somewhat surprising considering the hydrophobic nature of the parent material under low relative humidity and the relatively high pKa of the DABCO ligand. However, the zinc-carboxylate coordination is notoriously unstable and likely the weakest link which initiates the framework collapse, in spite of the Zn−N coordination from the DABCO ligand.",10.1021/ie202325p

The adsorption behavior of UiO-66 and DMOF-1 are analogous to pore filling in heterogeneous pore spaces of mesoporous silicas and carbons. MOFs with open-metal sites strongly bind water and exhibit isotherm shapes similar to zeolites 5A and 13X. These MOFs are difficult to regenerate after water exposure by heating under vacuum. PXRD patterns suggest that the crystalline structures are retained to some extent, but BET surface areas of the materials decreased substantially and are indicative of some structure loss during the adsorption-reactivation process likely due to the use of dry air as the carrier gas.

The chemical stability of the M-BDCs observed in this study cannot be explained by the bond strength (or bond dissociation energy), because the average bond strength follows the order of VO (637)> AlO (502)>CrO (461 kJmol1).[44] The coordination will not have a noticeable effect on the stability in this study, because the three M-BDCs have the same octahedral coordination.[34–36] It has also been reported that the stability of MOFs may increase with an increase in the oxidation state of the metal ions.[29] Therefore, oxidation state in this study does not have a dominant role in the stability of the M- BDCs considering the oxidation states of AlIII, CrIII, and VIII/VIV of Al-BDC, Cr-BDC and V-BDC, respectively, and that V-BDC is the most unstable structure. The oxidation state of V-BDC is +3 after synthesis and changes to +4 after purification by calcination at high temperature.[36, 40] The relative stability of the M-BDCs, however, may be explained by the inertness or lability of the metal ions. CrIII is a well-known inert ion, and the inertness of the ions follows the order of VIV <VIII<AlIII<CrIII.
The stability of the M-BDCs in an acidic solution (7.0 102m HCl, at room temperature) and in deionized water (pH: ~6.7, at 80 8C) have also been compared. Figures 2 and 3 show the relative surface areas and XRD intensities (Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information) of the M- Figure 1.

The change of XRD intensities with time shows a tendency similar to that of the surface areas. Even though the Cr- BDC is very stable to acid or water up to 48 h (Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4), the surface areas and XRD intensities of the Al-BDC decreases steadily and those of the V-BDC are very low just after 1 h. The very low surface area of the V-BDC after 1 h is due to the pore-filling with terephthalic acid (TPA; see below). Since water is a weak acid (pH is ~6.7 in this study), the relative stability in water at 80 8C is similar to that in HCl at room temperature. Figure 4 shows the changes of Al and V concentrations of filtrates of Al-BDC and V-BDC slurry (7.0 102m HCl) after maintaining for a fixed time. There is negligible Cr in the filtrate of Cr-BDC slurry up to 6 h. The degree of dissolution (calculated from the ICP results and chemical formula) of Al-BDC and V-BDC at 3 h are about 7.7 and 39.3%, respectively. These ICP results confirm that the stability of the MOFs in acids is Cr-BDC>Al-BDC>V-BDC, which is similar to the results obtained with nitrogen adsorption and XRD analysis.",10.1002/chem.201100316
