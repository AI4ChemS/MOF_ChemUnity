0,MAKGUD,unstable,10.1021/acs.cgd.6b00060,MAKGUD,Stable,"The phase purities of complexes 1–5 and 10–15 were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction patterns, as shown in Figure S3. Simultaneously, the stabilities of these complexes in the open air are also validated. Specifically, the prepared complexes 4 and 13 were exposed in open air, the medial humidity of which is 45% approximately, for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days, respectively. Then, the PXRD patterns were used to confirm the air stabilities (Figure). The results reveal that all complexes are stable when exposed in air containing water vapor, and they can keep their original skeletons completely in open air more than 7 days."
1,IVEQEG,unstable,10.1021/cm052149l,IVEQEG,Stable,"The thermal behavior of MIL-91(Al) shows a weight loss of 14.5 wt % below 473 K, corresponding to loss of physisorbed water molecules from the channels (ca.three water molecules per formula unit). If the MIL-91(Al) is heated in a vacuum at 393 K this water is removed to leave the dehydrated phase with a minor change in cell dimensions but with slightly broadened XRD peaks (Figure). This can be rehydrated upon standing in moist air to give the original phase. N2 adsorption on the dehydrated solid gives a type I isotherm that indicates the material has a Langmuir surface area close to 500 m2·g-1 and a micropore volume of 0.195 cm3·g-1 (Figure)."
2,EZOFUV,unstable,10.1021/ic200381f,EZOFUV,Stable,"Compound 3a is also stable against moisture since after treatment with water, the crystallinity was preserved. 3a has also been found to be tolerant against solvents such as ethanol, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile in solvent exchange experiments at room temperature."
3,FORWAL,unstable,10.1021/ic800356v,FORWAL,Stable,"The compounds were easily isolated in pure crystalline form upon slow evaporation at room temperature or addition of alcohol to the reaction mixture at 4 °C over a period of a week. Elemental analyses of the isolated crystalline materials suggested the molecular formulation K[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH)·3H2O for 1, (NH4)[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH) for 2, and Na[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH)·8H2O for 3, respectively. Attempts to quantitatively identify and account for stoichiometrically present chloride ions in the lattice of the derived species showed only spurious amounts. It appears that the use of ammonia, NaOH, and KOH as bases, usually added to raise the pH of the reaction mixture, led to their incorporation into the corresponding lattices of 1, 2, and 3. Further spectroscopic evaluation of 1−3 by FT-IR confirmed the presence of quinate bound to Fe(III), thus lending credence to the proposed formulation. Efforts were also made to pursue the synthesis and isolation of species under identical conditions of molecular stoichiometry of Fe(III):quinate, at higher pH values reaching up to 7. In all of those cases, the ultimately isolated crystalline product was identical to that of 1−3, but the yield was lower. The identity of the crystalline products 1−3 isolated in the extended pH range was proven through (a) FT-IR spectroscopy, and (b) X-ray cell determination of single crystals of the respective compounds."
4,VAGMAT,stable,10.1002/chem.201001549,VAGMAT,Stable,"Solid SNU-30 is insoluble in water and common organic solvents such as DMF, DEF, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), EtOH, MeOH, tBuOH, and MeCN."
5,UBIPAY,stable,10.1002/chem.201101321,UBIPAY,Stable,"""Because 2 is insoluble in common organic solvents and water, the crystals of 2 were decomposed by using an aqueous 10% HCl solution."""
6,WASPAI,stable,10.1002/ejic.200400960,WASPAI,Stable,The MOF is insoluble in water and common organic solvents.
7,BUCVIG,stable,10.1002/ejic.201500069,BUCVIG,Stable,"Complexes 1, 2, 1a and 2a are stable in air and insoluble in common solvents such as H2O, CHCl3, CH3CN, DMF and DMSO."
8,VEHLEA01,stable,10.1002/zaac.200900351,VEHLEA01,Unstable,"Compounds 1 and 2 are stable in air for several months and insoluble in common non-polar solvents, but slightly soluble in water. By immersing the crystalline samples of 1 and 2 in distilled water at room temperature for two days, the color of compound 1 and 2 obviously changed from deep blue to pink and the shape of the resulting product was totally different from those of 1 and 2. IR spectra and powder XRD patterns of the resulting products are similar with those of the neutral zinc phosphite with 16-ring channels, Zn2(H2O)4(HPO3)2·H2O [3l], indicating that both compounds have been transformed into a new phase representing a structural analogue of Zn2(H2O)4(HPO3)2·H2O."
9,TEBWII,stable,10.1002/zaac.201100376,TEBWII,Stable,"Compound 1 is insoluble in water and common organic solvents. Thus, compound 1 bulk-modified CPE becomes the optimal choice to study the electrochemical property of 1, which is inexpensive, easy to prepare and handle."
10,YUQNAB,stable,10.1021/acs.cgd.5b01050,YUQNAB,Stable,"The document states that the crystalline sample was immersed in a 3 M aqueous sodium salt solution of the required anion and left undisturbed at ambient temperature to allow anion-exchange. It also mentions that all of these products are found to be air-stable and insoluble in water. This indicates that the MOF retains its properties and structure after exposure to water, thus classifying it as stable."
11,ATAYAX,stable,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00154,ATAYAX,Unstable,"The compound {[Zn2(L)­(H2O)2]·(6DMF)·(2H2O)}(n1) is found to be air-stable and insoluble in common organic solvents or water. Framework 1 is unstable beyond 50 °C, as evidenced from the variable-temperature PXRD (VTPXRD) patterns. Given that ligand field stabilization energy is absent for a Zn2+ion (d10 electron configuration), removal of the metal-bound water ligand immediately leads to complete rupture of the framework in 1. Clearly, the unstable nature of 1 precludes obtaining an open framework structure for potential gas-storage applications."
12,VASGUU,stable,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02840,VASGUU,Stable,"To test the chemical stabilities of the three MOFs, their samples were treated in water. After being soaked in water at r.t. for 24 h, the measured PXRD patterns of BUT-70 and -70A show retained crystallinity with minor changes of the PXRD peaks, implying water stability of their robust frameworks."

""Interestingly, brief immersion of single crystal 2 into water or exposure to air for several days results in complete rehydration and formation of hydrated crystal Cu(4-pmpmd)(H2O)2(opd)·2H2O}, including two coordinated water molecules and three guest water molecules. Thus, the rehydration process is accompanied by return of the original blue color.""
2. ""The single-crystal X-ray structure determination of 3 revealed that the crystal system and space group remain the same as those of 2, but the copper center has re-form from a square planar (as in 2) to an octahedral coordination environment, owing to the introduction of coordinated water molecules."""

18,OHAKEO,stable,10.1021/cg900504m,OHAKEO,Unstable,"In an attempt to replace guest DMF molecules in1⊃2DMFwith water molecules, a crystal of1⊃2DMFis kept in DMF exposed to air for 2 weeks at room temperature.The crystal becomes shinier and affords another interesting 3D-framework {[Cd(IBA)2(H2O)]·DMF·3H2O}(n3) without losing crystallinity. We had also dipped the single crystals of1⊃2DMFin pure water for complete exchange of DMF with water molecules, but the crystals turn opaque within 2 h and no cell parameter can be obtained."
19,XACFAJ,stable,10.1021/ic025969y,XACFAJ,Stable,"The crystals of Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes, once precipitated with methanol, are water insoluble and nonhygroscopic."
20,OLUCAZ,stable,10.1021/ic034846q,OLUCAZ,Unstable,"Complex1 is insoluble in water and common organic solvents, and the crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis cannot be obtained by evaporating an appropriate solution of1. The structure cannot be recovered when this sample was exposed to water for a period of time. The appearance of some new sharpening peaks in the XRPD pattern of the rehydrated sample indicates that a new phase appears, and the crystallinity increases drastically with the rehydration."
21,PEQWAK,stable,10.1021/ic0611948,PEQWAK,Unstable,"After immersion in DEF, the solid does not contain DEF. It is revealed by Rietveld refinement that the dramatic change in the XRPD pattern is caused by the reduction of effective pore apertures. Because 2 contains accessible coordination sites on MnII, it adsorbs water vapor when solid 2 is exposed to water vapor for 3 days, which results in a XRPD pattern that is different from either 1 or 2. The shift of the peak at 2θ = 8.8° in 2 to a lower angle region (7.6°) indicates the expansion of the channel size upon exposure to water vapor. The IR spectrum showed a new water peak at 3392 cm-1, and the elemental analysis data indicated that two water molecules per MnII ion were included in the solid. It is assumed that a water molecule coordinates to the vacant coordination site of each MnII, and one water molecule per formula unit of 2 is included in the channel, which gives rise to a framework structure different from either 1 or 2."
22,UDANAQ,stable,10.1021/ic200937u,UDANAQ,Unstable,"The stability against water was also examined. The analysis of a water treated sample () shows that ZnW2(adb)2(dabco) can include water molecules undergoing a structural change. The water molecules incorporated in the structure cannot be completely removed by activation at 150 °C and N2 adsorption measurement reveals the low porosity of such material (BET surface area of 40 m2g–1(p/p0= 0.1–0.3)). Thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S8) shows that approximately 0.5 H2O molecule per Zn2(adb)2(dabco) was still enclosed after activation. Furthermore, the residual mass is 2.2% higher than expected, accordingly the sample already contains ZnO or Zn(OH)2. Hence, a slow decomposition is proceeding during hydration."
23,PUGGOP,stable,10.1021/ic5018517,PUGGOP,Stable,The PXRD pattern of compound I after the water adsorption experiment did not reveal any significant changes indicating the stability of compound I in an atmosphere of water vapor. It may be noted that a long exposure to water vapor may be required for the complete uptake of the water molecules in I.
24,VEQBID,stable,10.1021/ja062743b,VEQBID,Not Provided,"There is no mention of water stability in the document. The document discusses thermal stability, magnetic properties, and synthesis conditions, but does not provide information on the stability of the MOF in water, steam, or humidity."
