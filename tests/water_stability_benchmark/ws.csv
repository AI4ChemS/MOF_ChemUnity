The direct observation of two different types of protonated water clusters with unusual stability and their reversible transformation within the same cavity, a unique environment provided by the crystal host, could bring us closer to understanding the structural aspects and dynamic processes in forming proton hydrates. By virtue of the robustness of the frameworks, a stable, large protonated water cluster H+(H2O)21 can be obtained by dehydration of the abovementioned H+(H2O)28 cluster, and this newly formed protonated water cluster H+(H2O)21 can be restored to H+(H2O)28, completing a reversible process (Figure 2, left) in the cavity of the MOF.",10.1021/ja907023c

2. Testing conditions for water stability: The document does not provide specific testing conditions for water stability.

3. The exact sentences without any changes from the document that justifies your decision:

   - ""All compounds are insoluble in common organic solvents."" (This suggests that the compounds are not soluble in organic solvents, but it does not specifically address water stability.)
   
   - ""Because the solvent is the only variable in the reaction conditions, some empirical trends are found according to the relationship between the solvent and final products (Table S12 in the SI). Polar solvents prompt the assembly of 1 and 2, while lower polar solvents result in the formation of 3."" (This indicates that the solvent has a significant impact on the formation of the compounds, suggesting potential instability in different solvent conditions, including water.)
   
   - ""The blue crystals of 2 can convert to green powders of 3⊃1-PEA in the H2O/1-PEA mixture for 2 days under hydrothermal conditions."" (This indicates that the compound undergoes a transformation in the presence of water, suggesting instability.)
   
   - ""Similarly, 3 can also convert to 2 by heating in the H2O/EtOH mixtures."" (This further supports the idea that the compound is unstable in water or aqueous mixtures.)",10.1021/ic500436g

This is attributed to the higher stability of the Zr inorganic cluster. UiO-66 shows no change in PXRD pattern after exposure to liquid water and other solvents. The stability is attributed to the strength of the inorganic unit; each zirconium atom is 8-coordinated via terephthalic acid ligands. Water loadings of 0.37 cm3/g at 80% RH for both UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 match well with the value previously reported. Nevertheless, these water uptakes are less than pore volumes obtained via N2 adsorption. This is likely an attribute of the rehydroxylation of the materials during water exposure.
