On the basis of these predictions, we synthesized two frz-based MOFs using organic ligands that possess the water-frustrating properties reported above: Al-PMOF19 (m8o66) and Al-PyrMOF (m8o67).",10.1038/s41586-019-1798-7

""Figure 3c, d shows no loss of crystallinity upon activation as well as upon exposure to different harsh conditions, including immersion in water for 7 days."" 2. ""The ability of these materials to capture CO2 from wet flue gases is of important practical concern. We therefore used a breakthrough experiment to determine the capture capacity of both Al-PMOF and Al-PyrMOF for a mixture of CO2/N2 under dry- and humid-conditions24 (Fig. 4e). These results confirm the predictions of the simulations (Extended Data Fig. 7): humidity in the flue gases has only a minimal influence on the capture capacity of Al-PMOF, whereas for Al-PyrMOF the capture capacity is in fact enhanced. Furthermore, repeated cycling25 (Fig. 4f) does not result in degradation of the material or a change in separation performance.""",10.1038/s41586-019-1798-7

Conversely, m8o71 completely loses its CO2 capacity at 60% relative humidity (Fig. 2b). In Fig. 2c, d we visualize the hydrogen-bond network that is formed at 100% relative humidity in both materials. For m8o71 we see a complete hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 2d), whereas for m8o67 (Fig. 2c) we observe a less extensive network; the benzoate groups that separate the adsorbaphores frustrate the formation of a complete hydrogen-bonding network.",10.1038/s41586-019-1798-7

Ba2(EDTA) consists of a layered Ba2(EDTA) and Ba2(EDTA)·2.5H2O arrangement of coordination polyhedra whereas a framework containing channels is formed in the crystal structure of Ba2(EDTA)·2.5H2O. The polyhedral framework is able to release water by retention of the framework structure, which leads to a new water-free tetragonal phase. The reversibility of the process was proven by TG-DTA. In the crystal structure of Ba2(EDTA) the EDTA molecules reveal a stretched conformation whereas in Ba2(EDTA)·2.5H2O a folded conformation is observed.

Actually, the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a dehydrated sample (250 °C) is closely related to the pattern recorded for Ba2(EDTA)·2.5H2O and could be indexed with a tetragonal primitive unit cell (tP, a = 19.226(10) Å, c = 8.986(3) Å, V = 3335.4(3) Å3, ΔV = – 154.6 Å3).

The Cr-O bonds between the linker and metal atoms in the 1D chains of Cr-MIL-53 are about equally resistant to reaction with water as those of the Cr3-µ-OF6+ trimer in Cr-MIL-101. This suggests that the relative strength of the M-O bond is a more important factor than coordination geometry or valence for M3+- containing-PCPs than for M2+-containing ones. This hypothesis was confirmed by comparing the calculated stability of isostructural Al-MIL-5315 to Cr-MIL-53. That is, the Al-O bond in alumina is stronger than the Cr-O bond in Cr(III) oxide (514 compared to 447 kJ/mol, see Table S2).

Unlike HKUST-1, the water adsorption characteristics are completely different (Fig. 2). Despite its microporous structure adsorption occurs not until p/p0 = 0.4 revealing the hydrophobic character of the pores. As all aluminium ions are coordinated to oxygen atoms, there are no free coordination sites available. Additionally, the character of the non-polar, aromatic naphthalene linkers connecting the alumina-oxygen chains is highly hydrophobic. In the higher pressure region, additional adsorption occurs which is the result of condensation of water in the pores. Surprisingly, the experiment shows the opposite behavior of hysteresis. The desorption branch falls below the adsorption branch. We assume that this is due to partial decomposition of the framework during adsorption in the higher pressure region resulting in a higher water uptake. This water is then desorbed from a new solid phase with different water-surface interaction of lower binding strength leading to the steep decline of the desorption isotherm. A second measurement of the water sorption isotherms on the same sample confirmed this assumption as it revealed a similar shape of the isotherm, but the isotherms can not be superimposed. To analyze the water stability, the material was heated in water at 323 K for 24 h. The XRD powder pattern (Fig. S3) confirmed the partial decomposition of DUT-4, since the reflections are partly shifted and the amorphous background increased.

NU-1000 has triangular micropores as well as exceptionally large mesopores (ca. 30 Å diameter).

Examination of the PXRD patterns of NU-1000 soaked in H2O for 24 h but not activated, activated directly from H2O, and solvent-exchanged to acetone followed by thermal activation reveal that the crystallinity is maintained except when NU-1000 is activated directly from H2O. In particular the reflections centered at 5 and 7.5 degrees have broadened, while the peaks at higher angles have decreased in intensity. Consistent with the UiO-67 sample, N2 adsorption isotherms demonstrate that the sample activated directly from H2O exhibits significantly less porosity than either the pristine NU-1000 sample or the one activated via solvent-exchange.
