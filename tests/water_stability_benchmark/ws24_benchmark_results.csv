0,WOLREV,unstable,WOLREV,Unstable,This compound is water- and moisture-sensitive.
1,WOLRIZ,unstable,WOLRIZ,Unstable,"The document states that Cu[(Cu4Cl)(ttpm)2]2·CuCl2·5DMF·11H2O is 'water- and moisture-sensitive' and 'insoluble in nonpolar organic solvents, and is water- and moisture-sensitive.' This indicates that the MOF is unstable in water as it is sensitive to moisture and water."
2,ALAMUW,unstable,ALAMUW,Unstable,"The structure of SNU-50' contains a vacant coordination site at every CuII ion, and is extremely moisture sensitive; its dark blue color changes instantly to pale green on exposure to air, and its PXRD pattern becomes broadened, although the peak positions are similar to those of SNU-50 and SNU-50Ac (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). Once SNU-50' is exposed to air, it does not adsorb any gases even after it is reactivated."
3,UVUFUN,unstable,UVUFUN,Unstable,"PXRD analyses of the dehydrated [1]Cl have displayed a partial collapse of the framework in humid air over a few weeks (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). However, the material is stable for several weeks in a pre-dried inert gas containing less than 10 ppm of water."
4,USAHAZ,unstable,USAHAZ,Unstable,"The lack of a well-defined plateau at ca. 30% mass loss, which would have been consistent with the removal of three DEF molecules and the occurrence of a guest-free 3D framework, actually suggests that hydrogen bonded DEF molecules constitute an important element in ensuring the stability of the acetate-based 3D framework of 1. Attempts to remove DEF solvent molecules without damaging the three-dimensional framework of 1 were unsuccessful, even when the relatively mild conditions of the flowing supercritical CO2 procedure were used."
5,TAQGOK,unstable,TAQGOK,Unstable,"The three compounds DICRO-4-Ni-i, DICRO-5-Co-i, and DICRO-5-Ni-i were found to exhibit poor stability toward humidity, with BET surface area % reductions at 14 days exposure equal to −69%, −80%, and −68%, respectively. The greater stability in DICRO-5-Ni-i vs DICRO-5-Co-i for 1, 7, and 14 days corresponds with a trend in stability (Ni2+> Co2+) exhibited in divalent, transition metals complexes described by the Irving-Williams series."
6,XALDAS,unstable,XALDAS,Unstable,"The measured water isotherms are all of the same shape, with very little water uptake to approximately 0.4P/P0, then a broad step to a total uptake of 7–9 mmol/g. This type of adsorption curve is typical for hydrophobic MOFs, and the step is thought to indicate the pressure at which water molecules cluster in the pores. MSO2Pr-100 shows the least uptake in this range of all members in the series. Apart from MSO2Me-36, all the MOFs undergo pore filling above 0.4P/P0. Changing the MC-MOF composition does not greatly affect the partial pressure at which the pore filling step occurs in these materials, as might be expected with having similar pore sizes and functional groups. It is notable that the MOF with the pore-filling step at the highest humidity is MSO2Pr-100. We ascribe this to the increased hydrophobicity of the slightly smaller pores lined with the longer propyl tails. Additionally, all the MC-MOFs showed similar maximum water uptake of approximately 11 water molecules per formula unit (Table). These results are understandable given the similar hydrophilic properties of the sulfoxide and sulfone functional groups and the similar sizes of the pores in the MOFs."
7,YATDUV,unstable,YATDUV,Unstable,"The exchanged samples can retain their crystallinity after thermal activation at 85 °C under a vacuum for 48 h (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). However, they are sensitive to boiling water, as revealed by the new diffraction peaks in PXRD patterns (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information)."

14,GUVCOP,unstable,GUVCOP,Unstable,The crystals of the present coordination polymers were found to lose their crystallinity when exposed to air presumably due to loss of water of crystallization and decompose in the temperature range of 208−250 °C. The crystals are slightly soluble in water but insoluble in most common organic solvents.

17,TIDSEE,unstable,TIDSEE,Unstable,"All six compounds can be kept stable for a few weeks when stored in the dark, but they decompose readily in common solvents such as water, ethanol, and acetonitrile."
18,SIFVAG,unstable,SIFVAG,Unstable,"The hydrolytic stability of the NHC silver complexes merits a comment. Bis(carbene) complexes 2b–e were found to be indefinitely stable in air in the solid state, whereas mono(carbenes) 3a–e were extensively hydrolyzed under the same conditions and had to be stored under an inert atmosphere. The stability in solution is, however, more complex to describe because it depends on numerous factors, some of which are discussed below. Bis(carbenes) 2b–e again showed significant hydrolytic stability in pure water, and their aqueous solutions did not show any noticeable degradation (as evidenced by 1H NMR spectroscopy) when heated for hours or even days at 90 °C. Complex 2e was particularly stable in water and remained unaltered for at least 24 h at 100 °C, and two days at 130 °C, with only 3% hydrolysis. The behavior of complex 2a, in contrast, is quite remarkable. This complex has previously been described to be unstable in water. Indeed, we have discussed above that all attempts to synthesize this complex pure failed, as it was always obtained as an approximately 40–60% mixture with the corresponding imidazolium salt 1a. In an attempt to understand this result, two NMR tubes containing a D2O solution of the mixture of 2a and 1a (previously separated from the silver oxide/silver chloride precipitate) were prepared. One of these samples was heated for 24 h at 90 °C and showed no apparent changes in the composition of the 2a/1a mixture. This result clearly indicates that 2a is intrinsically stable toward hydrolysis. In a different experiment, in which sodium chloride (10 equiv with respect to silver) was added to the second sample, complex 2a was completely hydrolyzed in less than one hour at room temperature. Acceleration of the hydrolysis upon addition of NaCl was also observed for other bis(carbene) complexes, although the effect was less marked with NHC ligands that are hydrolyzed more slowly. The same effect was observed when bis(carbene) were heated in dmso with a small amount of added water. For instance, the percentage of hydrolysis of 2c after 15 h at 90 °C rose from 3% to approximately 30% in the presence of NaCl. Interestingly, the formation of small amounts of the mono(carbene) 3c was observed in the last process. Any analysis of the hydrolytic stability of mono(carbene) complexes 3 is necessarily complicated by the fact discussed above, namely, that they evolve to the corresponding bis(carbenes) in water. Nevertheless, the behavior of complex 3a was unique because it was completely hydrolyzed in water instead of evolving to the corresponding bis(carbene). This result does not necessarily mean that 3a is intrinsically more reactive with water than the other mono(carbenes) but only that hydrolysis of the NHC–Ag bond occurs faster than the transfer of NHC ligands between Ag centers in this case. Another important point with respect to mono(carbenes) is the reversibility of the hydrolysis observed in the solid state (Scheme a). Thus, when a hydrolyzed solid sample of 3a containing 24% of the NHC ligand in the form of the Ag complex (and 76% as imidazolium salt) was heated in dmso at 90 °C, the percentage of the mono(carbene) complex increased to 80% after 15 h. Similar transformations were observed for other complexes, although they were in general slower as the steric demand of the NHC ligand increased."
19,GAQYIH,unstable,GAQYIH,Unstable,"This complex is stable in air, soluble in water, methanol, and ethanol, slightly soluble in DMF, but insoluble in acetonitrile and nitromethane."
20,POHWIU,unstable,POHWIU,Unstable,"Strong coordinating solvents such as water release CO2 (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information), presumably by replacement at the paddle-wheel cluster (calculated binding energy with water: -23.53 kcalmol1), but it also causes the degradation of the framework, indicated by the disappearance of diffraction peaks in PXRD pattern (Figure S18 in the Supporting Information). However, we found that in a solvent that contains a small amount of water such as 190 proof ethanol (5% water), UNLPF-2 can completely release the CO2 while maintaining its crystallinity (Figure S18 in the Supporting Information). After five release–recapture cycles, only 60% of the CO2 capture capacity remained. This can be attributed to the water present in ethanol, which not only releases CO2, but also slowly degrades UNLPF-2. As the framework degrades, the ability to recapture CO2 also decreases."
21,OMEWUZ,unstable,OMEWUZ,Unstable,The complex is decomposed at 447 °C. Compound 1 is stable in air. It is moderately soluble in water and DMF but almost insoluble in common organic solvents.

Then, the PXRD patterns were used to confirm the air stabilities (Figure).

30,MOTMAK,unstable,MOTMAK,Unstable,"When exposed to air at room temperature, the dehydrated sample would quickly soak water. It illuminates that this dehydrated 3D framework with cubic cavities is a suitable host for researching the inclusion of water molecules. This dehydrated compound is sensitive only to water and methanol; it may be because the complex structure is hydrophilic, which makes the coordination polymer more easily form a hydrogen bond with polarized solvents."
31,IVEQEG,unstable,IVEQEG,Stable,"The thermal behavior of MIL-91(Al) shows a weight loss of 14.5 wt % below 473 K, corresponding to loss of physisorbed water molecules from the channels (ca.three water molecules per formula unit). If the MIL-91(Al) is heated in a vacuum at 393 K this water is removed to leave the dehydrated phase with a minor change in cell dimensions but with slightly broadened XRD peaks (Figure). This can be rehydrated upon standing in moist air to give the original phase. N2 adsorption on the dehydrated solid gives a type I isotherm that indicates the material has a Langmuir surface area close to 500 m2·g-1 and a micropore volume of 0.195 cm3·g-1 (Figure)."

35,FORWAL,unstable,FORWAL,Stable,"The synthesis of compounds 1−3 was pursued through a facile reaction between Fe(III) and quinic acid in aqueous media. The optimal pH, at which the reactions were developed, was in the range 3−3.5. The adjustment of pH was achieved through addition of KOH (1), ammonia (2), and NaOH (3). The general stoichiometric reaction leading to the formation of compounds 1−3 in Scheme.1

The compounds were easily isolated in pure crystalline form upon slow evaporation at room temperature or addition of alcohol to the reaction mixture at 4 °C over a period of a week. Elemental analyses of the isolated crystalline materials suggested the molecular formulation K[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH)·3H2O for 1, (NH4)[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH) for 2, and Na[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH)·8H2O for 3, respectively. Attempts to quantitatively identify and account for stoichiometrically present chloride ions in the lattice of the derived species showed only spurious amounts. It appears that the use of ammonia, NaOH, and KOH as bases, usually added to raise the pH of the reaction mixture, led to their incorporation into the corresponding lattices of 1, 2, and 3. Further spectroscopic evaluation of 1−3 by FT-IR confirmed the presence of quinate bound to Fe(III), thus lending credence to the proposed formulation. Efforts were also made to pursue the synthesis and isolation of species under identical conditions of molecular stoichiometry of Fe(III):quinate, at higher pH values reaching up to 7. In all of those cases, the ultimately isolated crystalline product was identical to that of 1−3, but the yield was lower. The identity of the crystalline products 1−3 isolated in the extended pH range was proven through (a) FT-IR spectroscopy, and (b) X-ray cell determination of single crystals of the respective compounds.

All three compounds 1−3 were insoluble in organic solvents, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, chlorinated solvents (CHCl3, CH2Cl2), toluene, and DMF. They were all stable in the air at room temperature for long periods of time.

X-ray Crystallographic Structures

The X-ray crystal structure of 1−3 reveals the presence of discrete species [Fe(C7H11O6)3], with accompanying cations and OH− anions in the lattice. The Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Plot (ORTEP) diagram for complex 1 is shown in Figure, while a packing view of complex 2 is provided in Figure A. A list of selected bond distances and angles for 1−3 are given in Table. Complexes 1−3 crystallize in the cubic crystal system and in the space group P213, with four molecules per unit cell. In all three cases, the metal-quinate assembly is the same from the coordination point of view. The structures show a mononuclear complex of Fe(III) with three quinate ligands coordinated to it. In all three complexes, each quinate acts as a bidentate ligand with the alcoholic (O1) and carboxyl (O5) oxygens coordinated to Fe(III). The quinate ligands are singly deprotonated, with the deprotonated site being the carboxylate group. The α-hydroxy group remains protonated and as such it coordinates to the metal ion center.

A similar case of a α-hydroxycarboxylate-metal complex with bound citrates had been previously observed in the case of Al(III) and Ga(III). Specifically, the complexes (NH4)4[Al(C6H4O7)(C6H5O7)]·3H2O and (NH4)4[Ga(C6H4O7)(C6H5O7)]·3H2O contained a similar coordination environment generated by two citrate ligands differing in their deprotonation state. The fact that the α-alcoholic group is protonated stands in contrast to the corresponding alcoholic group in the citrate ligand bound to M(III) in [M(C6H4O7)2]5−(M = Fe(III), Mn(III)). There, despite the presence of a α-hydroxycarboxylate moiety being present in the citric acid ligand, the alcoholic group was deprotonated upon coordination to the M(III) ion.

Preparation of Complex Na[Fe(C7H11O6)3]·(OH)·8H2O (3)

A quantity of FeCl3·6H2O (0.50 g, 1.8 mmol) was placed in a flask and dissolved in 3 mL of H2O. To that solution, d-(-)quinic acid (1.1 g, 5.5 mmol) was added slowly and under continuous stirring. Aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was then added slowly to adjust the pH to a final value of ∼3.5. The resulting reaction solution was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The color of the solution was yellowish and stayed as such. The resulting reaction mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature. Two months later, yellowish crystals appeared at the bottom of the flask upon slow evaporation. The crystals were isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo. The yield was 0.75 g (∼56%). Anal.

Crystal Structure Determination

The ionic strength of the investigated solutions was adjusted to 0.15 M with NaCl. The temperature was maintained at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C during the measurements. The titrations were carried out with a carbonate-free NaOH solution of known concentration (ca. 0.15 M). The NaOH solution was standardized using potassium hydrogen iodate (KH(IO3)2). The iron concentration was 1.0 mM, and the employed metal/ligand ratios were 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5. The pH was measured with a computer-controlled Crison titration system, elaborated for titrations at such low concentrations, and a Mettler Toledo-Inlab 412 combined glass-electrode, calibrated for hydrogen ion concentration according to Irving et al., by using the GLEE program. The ionic product of water was found to be pKw= 13.76.

The one step protonation constants of quinic acid are given as logK1, consistent with the equilibrium L−+ H+⇄ HL, whereK1= [HL]/[L−][H+]. The stepwise protonation constants of quinic acid are given as logK, consistent with the equilibriumnHn−1L+H⇄HnLwhereKn=[HnL]/[Hn−1L][H]

The initial computations were obtained in the form of overall protonation constants β= [HnL]/[L][H]n, taking into account that βn= ∏nnK.n

The concentration stability constants β= [MpqrLpHq]/[M]r[L]p[H]qfor quinic acid were calculated with Superquad.rThe corresponding βvalues for Fe(III)-quinate complexes, formed in the investigated system, were calculated with the PSEQUAD computer program.pqrThe pH-dependent species distribution curves and simulated titration curves were obtained from the measured overall formation constants with the HySS program.

The formation of hydroxo complexes of Fe(III) was taken into account in the employed calculations. For these calculations, the fact that ferric ions form several hydrolytic species in aqueous solution was taken into account. To that end, it should be noted that there is a disagreement on the subject of their values in the literature. The stability constants used for the hydroxo species of Fe(III) were taken from data of Lacour et al., and corrected toI= 0.15 M using the Davies equation: [FeH−1]2+(log β1−1= −2.67), [FeH−2]+(log β1−2= −6.49), [Fe2H−2]4+(log β2−2= −3.09), [FeH−3]0(log β1−3= −12.94), and [FeH−4]−(log β1−4= −22.49).

Overall, the quinate ligand plays the role of a bidentate metal chelator, effectively formulating the coordination environment around Fe(III).

The angles are in the range 78.08(8)−105.23(8)° for complex 1. They are similar to those in complex 2 (78.51(11)−104.91(12)°), 3 (79.09(15)−106.45(17)°), and cover a wide range around the ideal octahedral angle of 90°. The angle values in each case are similar to those observed in (81.86(8)−98.14(8)°)(4), (74.60(8)−108.40(9)°), (7) and (80.0(1)−94.0(1)°)(9) and similar to the quinate organic−inorganic hybrid [Mn2(C7H11O6)4]·nnH2O (69.56(15)−96.75(17)°).

In complex 1, each potassium ion is in contact with three carboxylate O-atoms from three quinate ligands, as well as bound to three disordered water molecules (O7 and O8). In the same species, each quinate ligand bridges one Fe(III) ion and one potassium ion through the two O atoms of the carboxylate moiety. The distance between K+ and Fe(III) is 6.725(1) Å. Each Fe(III) is connected via quinate bridges to three K+ ions, forming an equilateral triangle. Meanwhile, each K+ ion is located above the center of a Fe3-triangle (Supporting Information Figure), resulting in the formation of an infinite three-dimensional (3D) network (Supporting Information Figure).

In complex 2, the ammonium counterions replace the potassium cations of complex 1 and the N-atoms are in contact with the carboxylate oxygens (O6) of the quinate anion, as well as bound to OH− oxygens (O7) through hydrogen-bonding at distances in the range 2.774(7)−2.981(12)Å (Figure B). In complex 3, beyond the eight water molecules of crystallization in the lattice, there exist sodium ions each interacting with three pairs of adjacently located alcoholic oxygens (O4 and O5 from the quinate triol functionalities). Each alcoholic pair belongs to a separate discrete Fe(III)-quinate complex. The sodium, potassium, and ammonium ions in the respective lattices of 1−3 help link the assemblies together along with OH− ions. Consequently, a 3D network of hydrogen bonds forms, which involves quinate hydroxyl oxygens and carboxylate oxygens, as well as OH− oxygens. The resulting extensive hydrogen-bonding network very likely contributes to the stability of the crystal lattices in 1−3.

UV/vis Spectroscopy

The electronic spectrum of 1 was recorded in H2O. The spectrum showed bands at 354 nm (ε 1572 M−1cm−1), 334 nm (ε 1587 M−1cm−1), and 229 nm (ε 2652 M−1cm−1), with the latter feature rising well into the ultraviolet region. All three bands have been attributed to the presence of a quinate oxygen to Fe(III) Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT). The spectrum was featureless beyond 400 nm.

FT-IR Spectroscopy

Key to exploration of the chemical reactivity of the present binary system was (a) the use of the Fe(III):quinic acid molar ratio of 1:3, (b) the choice of three different counterions, and (c) the specific optimal pH values of the reactions run (pH 3−3.5). The synthesis of 1−3 in aqueous solutions, their isolation, spectroscopic and structural characterization provides a clear case of mononuclear Fe(III) species bearing the physiological substrate quinate. It appears that interaction of quinate with Fe(III), in the presence of three different counterions, leads to octahedral species in all three complexes 1−3 in the solid state. In all cases, the ionization state of the quinate ligand is in correspondence with the oxidation state of the metal ion. The singly ionized form of quinic acid (C7H11O6)1− derives from the deprotonation of the α-carboxylate group, with the alcoholic group remaining protonated. As a result of this interaction, a five-membered cyclic ring is formed, rendering the arising species quite stable. Hydroxide ions and/or water molecules of crystallization in 1−3 participate in the establishment of extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions throughout the corresponding lattices, contributing to the overall stability of the respective compounds. The physicochemical characterization of 1−3 reflected quite elegantly the inherent properties of the [Fe(C7H11O6)3]0 species under investigation in the solid state. The Mössbauer offered an affirmation of the oxidation state of the iron in the mononuclear assembly. The magnetic susceptibility studies defined well the magnetic properties of the species in the solid state, corroborating the EPR measurements in the solid state. The latter spectroscopic technique in the solid state and in solution lent credence to the X-ray crystallographic studies and the aqueous solution speciation studies, projecting the variable yet distinct structure of the Fe(III)-quinate species in the two (solid and solution) states.

The information provided by the multifaceted characterization of 1−3 reflects an important feature of the Fe(III) assembly in solution: that there is a neutral charge on the likely complex form [FeL2H−1]0 arising upon dissolution of 1. It suggests that the produced aqueous species can traverse cellular structures and interact further with both low molecular and high molecular mass targets. Thus, albeit a low pH structural variant, complex 1 (or 2 and 3) provides an expediently soluble form of iron, [FeL2H−1]0, one that potentially elicits interactions in biologically relevant fluids, not unlike those encountered in plant fluids.

Potential Relevance to Fe(III)-Hydroxycarboxylate Chemistry in Plants

Under growth conditions, when iron involvement is necessary to maintain plant physiological processes, iron in soluble and bioavailable forms is essential. Both solubility and bioavailability are attributes intimately associated with the pH-dependent distribution of binary species between Fe(III) and plant fluid physiological substrates exemplified by α-hydroxycarboxylate ligands, such as citrate (xylem sap), malate, lactate, and quinate. To this end, the herein reported aqueous speciation study on the binary Fe(III):quinate system has unravelled discrete species, reflecting the chemistry of solubilization of Fe(III) in the presence of the physiological metal ion chelator quinic acid. Albeit isolated in the low to intermediate pH range, complexes 1−3 project structural features consistent with those proposed by the solution speciation study. In this regard, well-defined soluble forms of Fe(III), present in the physiological pH range, could (a) elicit further ternary interactions with low or high molecular mass molecular targets and (b) participate in cellular pathways linked to the homeostatic physiology of lower and higher organisms, including plants.

The formation constants of species [FeLH−1]+(log β11−12.80) and [FeL2H−1]0(log β12−15.47) are higher than that of the monohydroxo species [FeH−1)]2+(log β1−1= −2.67). This way, what can be rationalized is the emergence of the (a) [FeLH−1]+ species at low pH (<4), reaching a maximum content of 80% around pH 2, and (b) [FeL2H−1]0 species, with a maximum content of 37% around pH 3 (Figure). Concurrently, it needs to be emphasized that the [Fe(OH)]2+ species is forming at pH < 5. In this regard, it is less likely for a complex species such as [FeL]2+ to appear at these low pH values. The formation constant of the [FeLH−1]+ species (log β11−12.80) is similar to that of the Fe(III) complex with lactic acid (2.05) reported at 1.0 M ionic strength. As with the Fe(III)-quinate system, a similar type of mononulear species were proposed upon complexation of Fe(III) with citrate.

From the aqueous speciation scheme it could be observed (Figure) that the 1:1 and 1:2 Fe(III):quinate stoichiometry is present for the majority of the species. In both stoichiometries of Fe(III):quinate, the binding mode of the quinate ligand could be either through the carboxylate group or through the carboxylate and α- alcoholate groups, while the remaining polyols do not enter the coordination sphere of Fe(III). In fact, chelate coordination of α-hydroxycarboxylate-containing ligands to Fe(III) through carboxylate groups is preferred in other divalent or trivalent metal ions, such as Cu(II), VO(II), and Al(III). In this regard, the possibility cannot be discounted that species such as [FeLH−1]+, [FeL2H−1]0, and so forth between Fe(III) and quinic acid could form structural binding isomers, in which the coordination sphere of the metal ion is filled by monodentate or bidentate bound quinate, hydroxide, and water ligands. In structures such as [FeLH−1]+ or [FeL2H−1]0, the additional H−1 could emerge upon dissociation of a coordinated water molecule in the coordination sphere of octahedral Fe(III) or even dissociation of the α-OH alcoholate group and coordination of the incipient α-O− group.

On the basis of the aforementioned grounds, a stepwise formation of [FeL2H−1]0 from the [FeLH−1]+ species could be logically proposed, according to the equilibrium: [FeLH−1]+ + L− ⇌ [FeL2H−1]0 logK=2.67

This value is similar to logK(FeLH−1) value (2.80), suggesting that likely only one ligand molecule is coordinated by a deprotonated alcoholate. The second ligand molecule is bound to Fe(III) in a (COO−, OH) fashion. A similar value (logK3.15) for the above equilibrium could be calculated for the Fe(III)-citrate system. This suggests that coordination of the second quinate ligand to Fe(III) is favored, likely aided by electrostatic attractions between the reacting species [FeLH−1]+ and L−.

Above pH 3.5, the dinuclear complexes [Fe2L3H−4]− and [Fe2L3H−5]2− predominate in the solution equilibria. The major complex in the pH range 3.5−5.8 is the [Fe2L3H−4]− species. The deprotonation of this complex according to the equation bears a p[Fe2L3H−4]− ⇌ [Fe2L3H−5]2− + H+ K8.05 and results in the emergence of a new dinuclear species. Because Fe(III) has been known to deprotonate α-hydroxycarboxylic acids, the deprotonation could refer both to quinate ligands and to the coordinated water molecules. The characteristics of this deprotonation (pK8.05) reflect a similarity to the deprotonation of the dinuclear species of Fe(III) with 1-phenyl-1-hydroxymethylene bisphosphonate and its analogues (pK8.6−9.5) at pH values beyond 6.

At pH 4.6, a maximum 85% of the iron is sequestered into [Fe2L3H−4]−. In this dinuclear species, the quinate ligands act as bidentate moieties. Three “H−1” moieties could be attributed to the deprotonation of water molecules in the coordination sphere of the two octahedral Fe(III) centers in a dinuclear core species. The fourth “H−1” could be attributed to the deprotonation of the alcoholic moiety of the quinate ligand, basically turning it into a bridge between the two Fe(III) centers.

In the case of a molar ratio of quinic acid: Fe(III) ≤ 3, a precipitate appears at pH over 4.3−4.4, but in the systems with a ratio greater than 3, beyond pH 4.5, a rapid increase of pH is observed until pH ∼ 10.5. In this pH range, where the equilibrium state is reached over a long period of time (more that 2 min for every point from Figure), [Fe2L3H−5]2− emerges as a dominant species, with a maximum percentile content of 88% at pH 7.0.

In the last part of the studied domain of pH, from 7 to 10.8, the three species present are [FeLH−3]−, [FeLH−4]−2, and [FeH−4]−, all mononuclear in nature. In the first two cases, the mixed hydroxo species [FeLH−3]− (it begins to appear at pH ∼ 5.5), and [FeLH−4]−2 (gradually growing from pH 9.5) might exhibit quinate binding isomer modes. The overall stability constant of the [FeLH−3]− species (log β11−3= −7.83) is higher than that of the corresponding trihydroxo species [FeH−3]0 (log β1−3= −12.94). For this reason, the formation of the iron trihydroxo species ([FeH−3]0) is less favored in the same domain of pH as the [FeLH−3]− species. The stability constant of the species [FeLH−4]2− (log β11−4= −19.45) is higher than that of the tetrahydroxo species [FeH−4]− (log β1−3= −22.49) but not to the same extent as for the previous two species. Thus, the tetrahydroxo species, as a minor tetrahedral Fe(III) species, is forming at pH > 9 to the extent of less than 2%. For this reason, this species was not drawn into Figure.

For these last two mixed hydroxo iron-quinate complexes, up to four water molecules could enter the coordination sphere around each iron ion. Consistent with the possibility of the α-alcoholate group of the quinate being deprotonated in the presence of Fe(III), in [FeLH−3]− species, one potential binding isomer formulation could encompass the central Fe(III) ion with a singly deprotonated quinate and three hydroxides originating from the deprotonation of an equivalent number of bound water molecules. In this case, the coordinated quinate prevents the precipitation of Fe(OH)3. In a second binding formulation, quinate coordinates in a bidentate (COO−, O−) fashion and only two OH− ions are ionized in the coordination sphere of the metal ion. The [FeLH−3]− species is the predominant species of the high pH range. At pH 10.3, around of 85% of iron is bound in this complex. Beyond pH 10, it is possible that a second deprotonation of quinic acid occurs at the α-alcoholate group. In the analogous case of [FeLH−4]2− species, quinate coordinates in a bidentate (COO−, O−) fashion and only three OH− ions are ionized in the coordination sphere of the metal ion. In view of the above remarks, the most likely stepwise deprotonation process involving both of the above-mentioned species is favored with a log[FeLH-3]− ⇌ [FeLH-4]2− + H+ K2.13.

Bearing in mind the aforementioned data, pFe values (pFe = −log[Fe(III)]free), given in Table, could be a more reliable choice for the evaluation of ligand effectiveness when comparisons are made with other Fe(III) binding ligands. That consideration is especially useful when taking into account the protonation constants of the ligand of interest at physiological pH (pH 7.40), with the total ligand concentration being 2−50 times that of the total iron concentration. For the Fe(III)-quinic acid system, pFe values were calculated through the HySS computer program. What could be observed from this table is that for the Fe(III)-quinic acid system, the pFe value is smaller than those for the other listed ligands. On the other hand, the p,Ka value for quinic acid (3.34) is much smaller than that of the listed ligands. Therefore, it appears that quinic acid acts as a fairly efficient Fe(III) binding ligand.

Speciation Studies

Potentiometric titrations of (a) the ligand quinic acid alone, and (b) Fe(III) with d-(-)-quinic acid in various metal ion to ligand molar ratios were carried out. Some of the obtained titration curves, both experimental and calculated, are shown in Figure. The titration curves were evaluated with various potential speciation models. The best fit between the experimental and calculated titration curves for the binary Fe(III)-quinic acid system was obtained by considering the mononuclear species [FeLH−1]+, [FeL2H−1]0 at low pH, the dinuclear forms [Fe2L3H−4]−, [Fe2L3H−5]2−, and the mononuclear species [FeLH−3]−, [FeLH−4]2− (LH = C7H12O6, and L = C7H11O6−) toward the end of the investigated pH range. The fit was reasonably good in the overall pH and concentration range used, demonstrating that the adopted speciation model is satisfactorily defined. Other 1:1 Fe(III):quinate complexes or variably protonated and deprotonated species were rejected by the computer program (PSEQUAD) during the computational process. The species emerging from the speciation distribution of the binary system (Figure) are reflected as structural derivative variants of species 1−3 synthesized and isolated in the solid state. As such, they indicate that the 3x(COO−, OH) composition in the six coordinate octahedral geometry, observed in the solid state, does not necessarily persist in solution in the whole pH range. The stability constants of the complexes formed are listed in Table. The uncertainties (3SD values) of the stability constants are given in parentheses. The pH range of their optimal formation is also reported. For the titratable carboxylate group of quinic acid, a pKa value of 3.34 was obtained and found to be very close to the values reported by Clifford (3.40) and Luethy-Krause et al. (3.36), being almost similar to the pKa (3.40) of chlorogenic acid (an ester of caffeic and quinic acid). For the congener shikimic acid ((3R, 4S, 5R)-3,4,5-trihydroxy 1-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid) the pKa value is 4.15. The presence of an alcoholic moiety in a position α- to the carboxylate group of quinic acid is associated with an increase of its acid strength, compared to shikimic acid. Furthermore, the four alcoholic moieties in the structure of quinic acid enhance its acidity in comparison to cyclohexane carboxylic acid (pKa 4.91).

The titrimetric data were evaluated on the premise that complex formation between Fe(III) and the quinate ligand proceeds through metal ion binding of the deprotonated quinate carboxylate and abutting protonanted alcoholic moieties. The titration curves in the absence and presence of Fe(III) suggest formation of hydroxocomplexes in the entire pH domain. In fact, the enhanced ability of Fe(III) to coordinate alcoholic/alcoholate groups allows for the formation of mixed hydroxo complexes in the entire pH domain investigated. It is worth noting that chlorogenic and caffeic acid were shown spectrophotometrically to form protonated complexes with Fe(III) at very low pH (1−2.5), but there was no spectrophotometric evidence for a reaction between quinic acid and iron(III). On the basis of the analytical and crystallographic data of this work, the alcoholic group of the quinate ligand retains its proton upon binding to Fe(III) in 1−3. Thus, there is seemingly no expected pH-dependence of the deprotonation of that group and the specific mode of binding to Fe(III) over the investigated pH range. Nevertheless, Fe(III) has been known for its ability to induce deprotonation of the weakly acidic alcoholic-OH group in α-hydroxycarboxylic acids such as citric acid.

The potentiometric titrations of the binary Fe(III)-quinic acid system illustrated in Figure show that from pH 2.3 to about pH 4 ([OH−]:[L] = 1.5) there is a significant region of interest. In this low pH region, three species coexist, namely, Fe(III), [FeLH−1]+, [FeL2H−1]0, and [Fe2L3H−4]−. The neutral species [FeL2H−1]0 attains a maximum content of 37% around pH 3 (Figure)."

The PXRD pattern of the sample measured at regular intervals showed no obvious change of the peak positions until 7 d of exposure to water vapor (Figure), authenticating that the framework integrity is maintained. The hydrophobic nature of the framework was checked by H2O sorption isotherm at room temperature, which shows large hysteresis. The water vapor adsorption isotherm of the desolvated sample (1Cu′) shows negligible water uptake up to 0.85 bar (Figure S21 in the Supporting Information), with a steep increase at higher relative pressure (p/p0 > 0.9). This performance is similar to the activated carbon, which has a hydrophobic surface. In addition, N2 sorption measurements were used to examine the porosity of the MOF samples after soaking in water (vide infra). The water stability of 1 can be explained on the basis of the following: (a) the Cu­(II)-SBUs possess increased ligand field stabilization energy that makes the ligand substitution processes less favorable (vide supra), and (b) functionalizing of ligand CuH4L with pendant fluorine creates a fluorine lining (hydrophobic) in the channel walls that imparts weak host–guest interactions between MOF walls and water molecules. As a result, the incoming water molecules tend to form a thin layer via H-bonding interactions outside the hydrophobic surface preventing water molecules to enter into channels and lead to collapse of the framework."

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies (Figure 2) indicated that the crystallinity of Cr-SXU-1 remains intact at pH 11, under extremely acidic (3m HCl aqueous solution), and other harsh conditions for at least 48 h. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Figure S6) showed that Cr-SXU-1 is thermally stable up to 4208C. This exceptional stability is comparable to that of other CrMOFs. Benefiting from the improved stability, CrSXU-1 exhibits permanent porosity, which was demonstrated by the N2 adsorption at 77 K (Figure 3). The Brunauer– Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area was calculated to be 4036 m 2g @1from the data points on the adsorption branch for P/P0 = 0.01–0.04. The experimental void volume of CrSXU-1 is 2.36 cm3g @1, which is consistent with that calculated from the single-crystal structure (2.20 cm3g @1). The N2 adsorption results at 77 K confirmed that the porosity of CrSXU-1 is maintained after treatment with 3m HCl or pH 11 aqueous solution."

Gd-pDBI was stable up to 72 h in boiling water and boiling methanol. Furthermore, it exhibited moderate acid (3n AcOH, 1n HCl) and base stability (0.1n NaOH) at RT for 24 h (Figure 2 c). This high chemical stability of Gd-pDBI is presumed to have resulted from coordinatively saturated GdIII centers with high binding energy of the GdO bond."
127,PUJJEL,stable,PUJJEL,Stable,"The porosity of 1 was characterized by N2 sorption measurements. The isotherm shows a steep slope at low P/P0 values with a type I character, which is typical for microporous materials (Figure 2).[36] The absence of hysteresis during the adsorption and desorption points indicated that the frameworks were stable and rigid. To the best of our knowledge, this surface area lies towards the upper end compared to other lanthanide (Ln=La–Lu)-based MOFs (Table 1). It is comparable even with highest reported surface area for rare-earth-based MOF.[37]"

The high thermal stability, water stability, and porous structure with accessible open sites of these MOFs provided suitable platforms for further luminescent applications (see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information)."
129,ELERIY,stable,ELERIY,Stable,"NJU-Bai20 shows the best water stability and its structure can be retained for more than one week in water (Figure S38 in the Supporting Information). This good performance can be attributed to two factors. First, half of the axial sites of copper paddle wheels are occupied by pyridyl groups with Cu¢N bonds, which are stronger bonds than Cu¢O bonds.[3a] When water molecules attack metal clusters, strong bonds ensure better resistance. Second, the hydrophobic acetylene groups in the ligands provide a hydrophobic environment in the pores."

""The high water and acid/base-proof stabilities of MFOF-1 are comparable with those of well-known stable Zr4+/Hf4+-based MOFs, RE-fcuMOFs, and MOFs with rigid multinuclear metal-oxide SBUs, and may be attributed to the synergistic effect of the high coordination number of Co2+, large rigid fluoride- and sulfate-bridged cluster as SBUs, the absence of solvent coordination sites on Co2+atoms, and the self-interpenetrated array."""

To further investigate the chemical stability of NNU-1, the sample was immerged in different pH solutions for 24 h, and the identity PXRD pattern before and after immerged demonstrated that the framework possesses excellent pH stability. In addition, NNU-1 is stable in some other solvents, such as CH3OH, CH3CH2OH, (CH3)2CHOH, DMF, dimethylacetamide (DMA), CH2Cl2, CHCl3, tetrahydrofuran, CH3CN, and CH3COCH3 at room temperature.

Moreover, these compounds were exposed in deionized water for 3 months, and aliquots of the solution, which were withdrawn periodically, showed no evidence of POM leaching on the research time scale monitored by UV−vis. The IR and XRD of the marinated compounds match that of the as-synthesized samples, confirming the maintenance crystalline framework."
141,OHUMIP,stable,OHUMIP,Stable,"NENU-501 and NENU-500 show good thermal stabilities in air, with decomposition starting at 300 and 366 °C, respectively. NENU-501 exhibits a continuous weight loss step from 366 to 554 °C, corresponding to the loss of all organic ligands and TBA+ ions. The residue corresponds to ZnO and MoO3. Furthermore, NENU-500 and NENU-501 are air-stable, maintaining their crystallinities for at least several months, and no efflorescence was observed. As polymeric materials, they are insoluble in common organic solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), chloroform, ethanol, and acetone. Remarkably, these POM-based MOFs are also stable in acidic and basic aqueous solutions in the pH range of 1–12 at room temperature, as confirmed by the subsequent PXRD and FT/IR measurements (Figures, S17, and S18). MOFs stable in both acidic and basic solutions are rare, especially for POM-based compounds, which often disintegrate in basic solutions. However, stability over a wide range of pH values is a prerequisite for HER catalysts of this kind."
