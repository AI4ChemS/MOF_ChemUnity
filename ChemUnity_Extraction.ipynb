The single-crystal X-ray structure and elemental analysis of 1′ establish clearly that 1a exhibits exclusive adsorption of water over methanol in such a binary liquid mixture; thus, we have shown a rare example of rationally tuned size/shape-selective microporous MOF for the removal of water from a water−methanol liquid mixture. Such selective liquid adsorption behavior is certainly attributed to the narrow pores within 1a, which has blocked the entrance of methanol into the 1D channel.\"\n",
