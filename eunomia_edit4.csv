1,Al-PyrMOF/m8o67,HELLOW,Water Stability,Stable,N/A,,"1. ""The ability of these materials to capture CO2 from wet flue gases is of important practical concern. We therefore used a breakthrough experiment to determine the capture capacity of both Al-PMOF and Al-PyrMOF for a mixture of CO2/N2 under dry- and humid-conditions24 (Fig. 4e). These results confirm the predictions of the simulations (Extended Data Fig. 7): humidity in the flue gases has only a minimal influence on the capture capacity of Al-PMOF, whereas for Al-Pyr- MOF the capture capacity is in fact enhanced. Furthermore, repeated cycling25 (Fig. 4f) does not result in degradation of the material or a change in separation performance."" 2. ""On the basis of these predictions, we synthesized two frz-based MOFs using organic ligands that possess the water-frustrating properties reported above: Al-PMOF19 (m8o66) and Al-PyrMOF (m8o67). These MOFs are based on one-dimensional rods of Al(iii) linked by TCPP (tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and TBAPy (1,3,6,8-tetrakis (p-benzoic acid)pyrene) ligands, respectively (Fig. 3a, b).

Unlike HKUST-1, the water adsorption characteristics are completely different (Fig. 2). Despite its microporous structure adsorption occurs not until p/p0 = 0.4 revealing the hydrophobic character of the pores. As all aluminium ions are coordinated to oxygen atoms, there are no free coordination sites available. Additionally, the character of the non-polar, aromatic naphthalene linkers connecting the alumina-oxygen chains is highly hydrophobic. In the higher pressure region, additional adsorption occurs which is the result of condensation of water in the pores. Surprisingly, the experiment shows the opposite behavior of hysteresis. The desorption branch falls below the adsorption branch. We assume that this is due to partial decomposition of the framework during adsorption in the higher pressure region resulting in a higher water uptake. This water is then desorbed from a new solid phase with different water-surface interaction of lower binding strength leading to the steep decline of the desorption isotherm. A second measurement of the water sorption isotherms on the same sample confirmed this assumption as it revealed a similar shape of the isotherm, but the isotherms can not be superimposed. To analyze the water stability, the material was heated in water at 323 K for 24 h. The XRD powder pattern (Fig. S3) confirmed the partial decomposition of DUT-4, since the reflections are partly shifted and the amorphous background increased.

The very low surface area of the V-BDC after 1 h is due to the pore-filling with terephthalic acid (TPA; see below). Since water is a weak acid (pH is ~6.7 in this study), the relative stability in water at 80 8C is similar to that in HCl at room temperature. Figure 4 shows the changes of Al and V concentrations of filtrates of Al-BDC and V-BDC slurry (7.0 102m HCl) after maintaining for a fixed time.

325,HKUST-1,HELLOW,Water Stability,Unstable,N/A,,"The open-metal sites also have a strong affinity for water, which will decrease the capacity for other gases when present in a mixture. Water vapor is typically present at various levels in CO2-containing streams such as flue gas. While the open-metal sites are known to interact favorably with CO2, the interaction with water is even more favorable. As a result, water will typically adsorb preferentially over CO2 in MOFs with open-metal sites, leading to lower adsorption capacity for CO2. Thus, limiting or preventing water uptake will improve the selectivity and capacity of the MOF for CO2. The water isotherms for HKUST-1, CuMBTC, and CuEBTC are shown in Figure 8. Because of the functional groups -CH3 and -C2H5, the decrease in water adsorption for CuMBTC and CuEBTC compared to HKUST-1 is pronounced. High adsorption loadings at high concentrations are typically a function of large pore volume. However, the pore volume differences between HKUST-1 Figure 6.

The discovery of new high-surface area metal–organic frameworks that are stable to air, water, other chemical agents, and high temperatures is an important step in extending the versatility of these metal–organic frameworks. To this end, it has been shown that microporous imidazolate-bridged frameworks can exhibit high thermal stability and remarkable chemical resistance in boiling alkaline water and other solvents. This behavior is likely due to the greater basicity of imidazolate, as reflected in the significantly higher pKa of imidazoles relative to carboxylic acids, which results in stronger metal–ligand bonds. Given that pyrazoles have similar high pKa values, pyrazolate-based metal– organic frameworks should also exhibit good thermal and chemical stability.

359,"Al(OH)(1,4-NDC)",HELLOW,Water Stability,Unstable,N/A,,"The adsorption isotherm of water shows no uptake up to 9.5 mmHg followed by a steep rise and the attainment of the saturation capacity of 204 cm3 g-1 (8.9 molecules per unit cell) at P/P0 = 0.4 with a large hysteresis loop; thus, it can be classified as type V. The existence of a pressure threshold is less common in PCPs since most PCPs show a high affinity for the presence of hydrophilic sites in their frameworks. The behavior of Al(OH)(1,4-NDC) is instead typical of hydrophobic pore surfaces, and this behavior suggests the formation of only weak guest-wall interactions as a consequence of the presence of naphthalene rings lining the nanochannel walls.",10.1021/ja802589u 
360,UTSA-16,HELLOW,Water Stability,Stable,Not applicable,,"UTSA-16 exhibits repeatable and reversible CO2 sorption (Supplementary Fig. S7). More importantly, the re-activated UTSA-16 from the used sample, which has been exposed in the air for 3 days, still keeps the same sorption capacities for CO2, indicating that UTSA-16 is not air sensitive. It needs to be mentioned that the existence of the coordinated water molecules is essential for UTSA-16 to have high CO2 capture capacity. In fact, once all the water molecules within UTSA-16 are removed at elevated temperature, the resulting anhydrous material is non-porous.",10.1038/ncomms1956

However, because the interactions of Mg-MOF-74 with water molecules are very strong, Mg-MOF-74 is highly sensitivity to the moisture, leading to its significantly reduced CO2 storage capacities once it is exposed to the air.",10.1038/ncomms1956

Compound 1 represents a rare example of a MOF with open channels that form/collapse reversibly upon hydration/dehydration. It can be used as a desiccant that adsorbs water molecules very selectively. Compared to traditional molecular sieves that are widely used as desiccants for organic solvents, 1 possesses the following advantages: first, the adsorbed water molecules can be removed under relatively lower temperatures and, second, 1 can selectively adsorb water molecules over organic solvents.",10.1021/ic7004908
