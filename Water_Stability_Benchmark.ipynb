Each of the resulting H(H2O)21+ protonated water clusters has a hexahedral (H2O)20 shell, with each of its faces making an octagonal water ring as (H2O)8. The O(1W)··· O(2W) separations in the hexahedral (H2O)20 shell of the H(H2O)21+ cluster are revealed to be the same as those of the H(H2O)27+ and H(H2O)28+ clusters, respectively. It is also found that the shortest O ··· O separation between the water molecules in the center core and that in the water shell is ca. 4.04 Å, which is much longer than normal O ··· O hydrogen bonds, suggesting an isolated center core in the interior of the cluster. The excess proton should be localized on the water molecule at the center, forming an unattached hydronium ion as a center core, since only ionic species could be confined individually at the crystallographic center of the cluster by the strong and specific pseudo-spherical static field applied by the MOFs. Otherwise, a neutral water molecule was hardly isolated at the center, and it would be deviated from the center to the water shell via hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, the acetonitrile molecules surrounding the protonated water clusters in the cavities were not removed at all under the dehydration conditions, probably due to the relatively small diameters of the channels that selectively allow smaller species to pass through but not acetonitrile molecules. Last, these acetonitrile molecules seem to serve as linkers to connect the large polyoxotungstate or polyoxomolybdate anions with the water clusters.\n",

The TG profile of 3 shows that all the coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules are lost at 80 °C, and heating 3 to 110 °C for 2 h completely reverses the structural change, reconstituting the original material 2.

The single-crystal X-ray structure determination of 3 revealed that the crystal system and space group remain the same as those of 2, but the copper center has re-form from a square planar (as in 2) to an octahedral coordination environment, owing to the introduction of coordinated water molecules. It is worth mentioning that on rehydration the two closely packed interpenetrating networks undergo stress relax, which is due to the expansion of the channel size (5.72 Å) to provide a void space composing 31.3% of the total crystal volume. The TG profile of 3 also exhibits a stepwise release and shows that all the coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules are lost at 80 °C (calcd, 10.0%; found, 9.8%) (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Thus, heating 3 to 110 °C for 2 h completely reverses the structural change, and the original material 2 is reconstituted after the removal of all the water molecules. After determining the structure, the simulated powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD) was found to match that of as-synthesized compound 1.\n",

When compound 3 was heated in boiling water, a new crystalline phase Zn12[Zn2(H2O)2]6(BTP)16 (30) was obtained, as identified by X-ray powder diffraction. The same phase was also isolated through the reaction of 3 in a concentrated basic solution (NaOH, pH 14) for 30 min. Although 3 is highly resistant to high temperatures (up to 510 C), the solid-state transformation in basic pH conditions occurs at room temperature in a very short time, indicating that the presence of water is critical to its instability. Compound 30 crystallizes in the cubic space group Pn3n. The best structural model derived from our X-ray powder diffraction analysis was found to contain one-dimensional chains running along the three crystallographic axes. Two crystallographically distinct zinc(II) centers, referred to as Zn1 and Zn2, alternate along the chains (see Fig. 3). Site Zn1 possesses a tetrahedral stereochemistry, with coordination by four nitrogen atoms belonging to the pyrazolate moieties of four distinct BTP3- ligands. Situated at the vertices of a [Zn2(H2O)2] 4+ rhombic unit, Zn2 shows a cis-ZnN2O2 tetrahedral stereochemistry, where the nitrogen atoms belong to pyrazolate groups from two distinct BTP3- ligands. Due to the orientational disorder affecting the rhombic units (which reside on a crystallographic four-fold axis), along each chain, Zn1 may be bridged, by the BTP3- ligands, either to Zn2, via a Zn–N bond, or to a water molecule, via a N/HO hydrogen bond (see Fig. S5, ESI†). Given the overall coordination mode of the BTP3ligands, which employ all of their nitrogen atoms to form bonds, the chains are mutually connected to give a dense, three-dimensional framework with no voids or channels for hosting solvent. As expected in the absence of guest solvent molecules, thermogravimetric analysis shows no weight loss for the compound up to decomposition, which occurs at a rather high temperature of above 400 C (see Fig. S8, ESI†). Gas adsorption properties Prompted by their porous structures, we evaluated the permanent porosity of compounds 1–4 by collecting N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K. Complete removal of coordinating solvents without collapsing the structure is not always trivial, however, due to an activation barrier which should be overcome by applying vacuum and high temperatures, often subsequent to solvent exchange using a volatile coordinating solvent such as methanol. To determine the optimal activation temperatures of the methanol-exchanged phases, the samples were heated under dynamic vacuum at gradually increasing temperatures, while N2 adsorption was repeatedly measured at each stage. From the N2 isotherm measurements, the best activation method for compounds 1 and 2 was determined to be application of dynamic vacuum at 250 C for at least two days. With no bound solvent, 3 and 4 can be activated by heating under vacuum at the lower temperature of 160 C for two days. The optimally desolvated materials were found to adsorb significant amounts of N2 at 77 K, displaying Type I adsorption isotherms characteristic of microporous solids (see Fig. 4).

Sci., 2011, 2, 1311–1319 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 Fitting the N2 isotherms afforded BET surface areas of 1650(20), 1860(10), 930(10) and 1027(3) m2 g-1 and Langmuir surface areas of 1900(13), 2159(10), 1242(11) and 1588(40) m2 g-1 for 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Perhaps owing to a smaller unit cell dimension, the surface areas of 1 and 2 are slightly lower than observed for Mn-BTT, which, thanks to the (m4-Cl induced) inflation of the inner Mn4 core (vide supra), displayed a BET surface area of 2100 m2 g1. 14a Actually, for 3D isostructural materials sharing the same ligand and slightly different cores, also the empty volume is significantly affected by the cooperative change in size of the metallic nodes, here addressed by the M/M contacts in the inner M4 square (with a linear inflation, on passing from Ni4 (or Cu4) to [(m4-Cl)Mn4], larger than 20%, see above). Similarly, a ca. 0.1 A increase of the metal radius on passing from Cu to Pd in the sodalitic M(n-pymo)2 frameworks (n-pymo- ¼ pyrimidinn-olate) allowed the increase of nearly 30% of the void volume and of ca. 80% of the BET surface area.23 Notably, the increase in surface area from 1 to 2 is also consistent with their unit cell dimension and void volume, which is ultimately related to the ionic radii of the two metal ions (see above). The surface area of 3 and 4 are also consistent with that of Zn(1,3-BDP) and Co(1,3- BDP), which display much similarity in the framework connectivity and pore size.7e Thermal behavior In order to probe the thermal stability of the new compounds, thermogravimetric analyses were performed, combined with in situ variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction experiments. While the thermogravimetric analyses were carried out under N2 for as-synthesized compounds 1–4, complete and detailed characterization of the thermal behaviors of 1–3 were carried out in air by means of variable-temperature diffraction experiments. As depicted in Fig. 5 the thermogravimetric trace of 1 shows a weight loss of 30% between 30 and 150 C, corresponding to the partial evolution of guest solvent (4 methanol and 16 water molecules corresponds to 30%). A gradual further weight loss of 15% occurs in the range 150–430 C, consistent with the evolution of DMF solvent molecules coordinated to the metal sites (3 DMF molecules corresponds to 16%). Further heating prompts decomposition at 450 C. In the TG trace of 2, a 30% weight loss occurs below 50 C, corresponding roughly to the evolution of 5 methanol and 10 water molecules (29%). A gradual weight loss of 8% then follows up to 410 C, consistent with the loss of 3 metalcoordinated methanol molecules, and further heating induces decomposition. The foregoing observations are consistent with thermodiffractometric analyses (see Fig. 6 and S9, ESI†).

Indeed, solvent loss does not significantly affect the crystal structures, with the powder diffraction patterns remaining largely unchanged up to 450 C for 1 and 390 C for 2. Notably, parametric Le Bail refinements against the data show that the two compounds respond to heat with a distinct framework flexibility. In the case of 1, the unit cell volume remains almost constant up to ca. 200 C, while above this temperature, a modest contraction, reaching 0.5%, is observed. In comparison, the unit cell volume of 2 experiences a modest, yet continuous, decrease in the temperature range 30–350 C, reaching 0.8% (see Fig, S10 and S11, ESI†). As evidenced by their thermal behavior, compounds 3 and 4 provide further examples of robust metal–organic frameworks. High thermal and chemical stability in pyrazolate-bridged metal–organic frameworks with exposed metal sites† Valentina Colombo,abc Simona Galli,c Hye Jin Choi,ab Ggoch Ddeul Han,ab Angelo Maspero,c Giovanni Palmisano,c Norberto Masciocchic and Jeffrey R. Long*ab Received 7th March 2011, Accepted 1st April 2011 DOI: 10.1039/c1sc00136a Reactions between the tritopic pyrazole-based ligand 1,3,5-tris(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzene (H3BTP) and transition metal acetate salts in DMF afford microporous pyrazolate-bridged metal–organic frameworks of the type M3(BTP)2$xsolvent (M ¼ Ni (1), Cu, (2), Zn (3), Co (4)). Ab-initio X-ray powder diffraction methods were employed in determining the crystal structures of these compounds, revealing 1 and 2 to exhibit an expanded sodalite-like framework with accessible metal cation sites, while 3 and 4 possess tetragonal frameworks with hydrophobic surfaces and narrower channel diameters. Compounds 1–4 can be desolvated without loss of crystallinity by heating under dynamic vacuum, giving rise to microporous solids with BET surface areas of 1650, 1860, 930 and 1027 m2 g1, respectively. Thermogravimetric analyses and powder X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate the exceptional thermal and chemical stability of these frameworks. In particular, 3 is stable to heating in air up to at least 510 C, while 1 is stable to heating in air to 430 C, as well as to treatment with boiling aqueous solutions of pH 2 to 14 for two weeks. Unexpectedly, 2 and 3 are converted into new crystalline metal–organic frameworks upon heating in boiling water. With the combination of stability under extreme conditions, high surface area, and exposed metal sites, it is anticipated that 1 may open the way to testing metal–organic frameworks for catalytic processes that currently employ zeolites.

Conclusions The foregoing results demonstrate the use of the new triangular trispyrazole molecule H3BTP in construction of microporous frameworks of the type M3(BTP)2 (M ¼ Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) exhibiting exceptional thermal and chemical stability. In particular, Ni3(BTP)2 retains its integrity in the face of an unprecedented range of extreme conditions, including heating in air to 430 C and treatment with boiling aqueous solutions of pH 2 to 14 for two weeks. Thus, this stability parallels, or even surpasses that of zeolites, where the presence of selectively removable Al sites makes their frameworks unstable in highly acidic and basic conditions.25 Moreover, Ni3(BTP)2 represents the first highstability metal–organic framework with accessible metal sites lining the pore surfaces. Such a remarkable combination of properties may open the way for testing metal–organic frameworks in a variety of applications that currently employ zeolites under extreme conditions. Indeed, future efforts will focus on exploring the performance of these new high-surface area materials in various high-temperature catalytic processes, as well as on the synthesis of other pyrazolate-based metal–organic frameworks featuring exposed metal sites. Moreover, its stability in basic media enabled grafting of ethylenediamine on the open Cu2+ sites, leading to a record heat of CO2 adsorption for a metal–organic framework. In order to achieve a still greater level of stability, approaching that of zeolites, pyrazolate-bridged analogues of this important structure type were sought. Herein, we report the synthesis of the new linker 1,3,5-tris(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzene (H3BTP, see Fig. 1a), and its use in generating a series of exceptionally robust metal–organic frameworks, two of which adopt the Mn-BTT structure and feature exposed metal cation sites. Results and discussion Synthesis and structure of sodalite-type Ni3(BTP)2 and Cu3(BTP)2 phases Reaction of H3BTP with nickel(II) or copper(II) acetate in DMF at 160 C afforded, upon washing with methanol and drying in air, Ni3(BTP)2$3DMF$5CH3OH$17H2O (1) and Cu3(BTP)2$8- CH3OH$10H2O (2) as yellow and brown microcrystalline powders, respectively. Preliminary powder X-ray diffraction acquisitions showed both compounds to be isomorphous with the sodalite-like structure of Mn-BTT.14a The latter compound consists of chloride-centered [Mn4(m4-Cl)]7+ squares linked via triangular BTT3- ligands to form a porous, three-dimensional framework in which each metal center further has a bound DMF molecule directed into the pores. Overall, the framework has an anionic charge, which is balanced by [Mn(DMF)6] 2+ cations included in the pores. Despite the great similarity in size and shape between H3BTT and H3BTP, our attempts at synthesizing a Mn-BTT analogue using H3BTP and various metal chlorides were unsuccessful. Instead, the use of metal acetates in DMF was found to promote the deprotonation of the pyrazole ligand to form M–N bonds and the extended sodalite-like framework structure of 1 and 2. As assessed by X-ray powder structure analysis, 1 and 2 are isomorphous, but not isostructural with Mn-BTT. Specifically, the m4 bridging chloride anion present in Mn-BTT, is absent in 1 and 2, as evidenced by elemental analysis and X-ray fluorescence (see Fig. S6, ESI†) and consideration on their structural features (see below). Compounds 1 and 2 crystallize (see Fig. 1) in the cubic space group Pm3m, with the metal ions lying on crystallographic twofold axes and arranged in tetranuclear cores of rigorous, crystallographically-imposed square symmetry, with M/M edges of 3.118(6) and 3.013(7) A, for  1 and 2, respectively. The chlorocentered Mn4 squares in Mn-BTT showed Mn/Mn distances of 3.70(3) A, in agreement with the presence of the inner  m4-Cl ion and leading to a larger accessible empty volume (as measured, e. g., by the BET specific area, vide infra).23 In 1 and 2, each M/M edge is bridged by pyrazolate groups from two distinct BTP3ligands, resulting in a square-planar coordination geometry at each metal ion. Residing on a 3m crystallographic site, each BTP3- ligand employs its three pyrazolate substituents to bridge M/M edges of three different M4 squares. Each square is connected to eight adjacent squares, generating a rigid threedimensional framework. Thus, the framework structure features octahedral cavities centered at [1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ], with BTP3- ligands spanning each face and M4 squares truncating each vertex to give 1312 | Chem. Sci., 2011, 2, 1311–1319 This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011 an expanded sodalite cage unit. The sharing of squares between neighboring cage units along the three unit cell axes, results in one-dimensional channels running parallel to the cell axes. These channels have a wide diameter of nearly 10 A (based upon van der Waals radii). Yet, only a very small entrance, possibly limiting the size and shape of adsorbable gases, allows access to the ca. 6-A cavity within the octahedral, sodalite-like cage units. Along this line, our strategy has involved the use of polyazolate-bridging ligands,10 that can lead to frameworks with strong metal–nitrogen bonds, providing a greater chemical and thermal stability compared to their carboxylate-based counterparts. Employing polyazolate heterocycles, the strength of the resulting M–N bonds can be predicted to be closely related to the pKa values for the deprotonation of the N–H bond. Indeed, increased stability has been observed for frameworks generated from organic ligands functionalized with 1,2,3-triazole (pKa ¼ 13.9)11 than for analogues based upon tetrazole (pKa ¼ 4.9).11,12 Imidazole, with an even higher pKa of 18.6,11 has been shown to afford frameworks of still greater thermal stability (Tdec up to 390 C) and some chemical resistance to alkalinity and boiling solvents such as water, methanol and benzene.7a In particular, however, organic ligands functionalized with pyrazole (pKa ¼ 19.8),11 are of interest for the synthesis of robust pyrazolatebridged frameworks. A number of pyrazolate-based metal–organic frameworks exhibiting exceptional stability have already been realized. For example, 1,4-bis(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzene (1,4-H2BDP) was found to react with salts of cobalt(II),13 nickel(II) or zinc(II) 7d,e to afford frameworks exhibiting good thermal stability (Tdec ¼ 420– 460 C) and permanent porosity with Langmuir surface areas between 1600 and 2670 m2 g1. Employing instead the bent molecule 1,3-bis(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzene (1,3-H2BDP) results in a double-walled zinc-based framework of even greater thermal stability (Tdec ¼ 500 C), which further shows chemical stability in a hot acidic solution (pH 3).7e The thermal stability of pyrazolate-based materials was again observed for the cubic frameworks Ni8L6(OH)4(H2O)2 with L ¼ 4,40-bis(1H-pyrazol-4yl)biphenyl (Tdec ¼ 420 C) or 2,6-bis(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyrrolo [3,4-f]isoindole-1,3,5,7(2H,6H)-tetrone (Tdec ¼ 410 C).7f Furthermore, a Cu(I) framework based on 3,30,5,50-tetramethyl4,40-bipyrazolate (H2Me4bpz) was found stable up to 500 C in nitrogen atmosphere but also in air atmosphere with a decomposition temperature of above 400 C.7h On the whole, the thermal and chemical stability of pyrazolate-based frameworks is indeed significantly increased relative to the tetrazolate- and triazolate-bridged frameworks. We note, however, that none of these high-stability pyrazolate-based frameworks possess internal surfaces bearing open metal coordination sites. Exposed metal cations within metal–organic frameworks have been demonstrated to lead to outstanding properties for hydrogen storage,14 gas separations,4b–e,12,15 and catalysis.6 Among the azolate-based metal–organic frameworks of this type, Mn3[(Mn4Cl)3(BTT)8]2$20MeOH (Mn-BTT, H3BTT ¼ 1,3,5-tris(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzene), a rigid high-surface area framework with an expanded sodalite-like structure and exposed Mn2+ sites, exhibited a high H2 binding affinity14a and Lewis acid catalysis.6c Unfortunately, the relatively low thermal stability (Tdec z 200 C) and water-sensitivity of this tetrazolate-bridged framework limits its utility. Attempts to synthesize analogous triazolate-based structures afforded the more stable framework H3[(Cu4Cl)3(BTTri)8] (Cu-BTTri, H3BTTri ¼ 1,3,5-tris(1H1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)benzene).12 With improved thermal stability (Tdec ¼ 270 C), this compound exhibits substantial chemical resistance, retaining its porous structure in dilute HCl solution (pH 3) at room temperature or in boiling water for 3 days. Moreover, its stability in basic media enabled grafting of ethylenediamine on the open Cu2+ sites, leading to a record heat of CO2 adsorption for a metal–organic framework.\n",

Unlike HKUST-1, the water adsorption characteristics are completely different (Fig. 2). Despite its microporous structure adsorption occurs not until p/p0 = 0.4 revealing the hydrophobic character of the pores. As all aluminium ions are coordinated to oxygen atoms, there are no free coordination sites available. Additionally, the character of the non-polar, aromatic naphthalene linkers connecting the alumina-oxygen chains is highly hydrophobic. In the higher pressure region, additional adsorption occurs which is the result of condensation of water in the pores. Surprisingly, the experiment shows the opposite behavior of hysteresis. The desorption branch falls below the adsorption branch. We assume that this is due to partial decomposition of the framework during adsorption in the higher pressure region resulting in a higher water uptake. This water is then desorbed from a new solid phase with different water-surface interaction of lower binding strength leading to the steep decline of the desorption isotherm. A second measurement of the water sorption isotherms on the same sample confirmed this assumption as it revealed a similar shape of the isotherm, but the isotherms can not be superimposed. To analyze the water stability, the material was heated in water at 323 K for 24 h. The XRD powder pattern (Fig. S3) confirmed the partial decomposition of DUT-4, since the reflections are partly shifted and the amorphous background increased. Apparently, the material is stable at ambient atmosphere but direct contact with water leads to gradual decomposition.\n",

We therefore extended the water soaking period to 7 and 30 days; the PXRD pattern shows no loss in crystallinity (Fig. S24†), and SEM images show only minimal pitting on the crystal surface after 7 or 30 days soaking in water (Fig. S23†). To further prove that the material remains intact upon extended exposure to water, we collected CO2 isotherms at 273 K for samples of bio-MOF-14 which were soaked in water for either 7 or 30 days (Fig. 12). The isotherms are nearly identical and they closely match the isotherm of the non-water-treated sample in both shape and capacity, indicating that water does not affect the porosity of the material.\n",

      "Water Stability = UnstableN/A ; conditions: Exposure to humid air ; Justification: The anhydrates are stable under dry air, and the samples rehydrate on exposure to humid air. Water vapor is typically present at various levels in CO2-containing streams such as flue gas. While the open-metal sites are known to interact favorably with CO2, the interaction with water is even more favorable. As a result, water will typically adsorb preferentially over CO2 in MOFs with open-metal sites, leading to lower adsorption capacity for CO2. Thus, limiting or preventing water uptake will improve the selectivity and capacity of the MOF for CO2. Because of the functional groups -CH3 and -C2H5, the decrease in water adsorption for CuMBTC and CuEBTC compared to HKUST-1 is pronounced. High adsorption loadings at high concentrations are typically a function of large pore volume. However, the pore volume differences between HKUST-1 and CuMBTC and CuEBTC cannot totally account for the fact that HKUST-1 adsorbs triple the amount of water compared to the two functionalized MOFs. Clearly, the alkyl functional groups extending from BTC into the pore space are depressing the water adsorption, in spite of the large porosity and presence of open-metal sites. As shown in Figure 2, the PXRD patterns do not change significantly from the activated sample after exposure to 90% relative humidity.\n",

The existence of a pressure threshold is less common in PCPs since most PCPs show a high affinity for the presence of hydrophilic sites in their frameworks.

Each of the resulting H(H2O)21+ protonated water clusters has a hexahedral (H2O)20 shell, with each of its faces making an octagonal water ring as (H2O)8. The O(1W)··· O(2W) separations in the hexahedral (H2O)20 shell of the H(H2O)21+ cluster are revealed to be the same as those of the H(H2O)27+ and H(H2O)28+ clusters, respectively. It is also found that the shortest O ··· O separation between the water molecules in the center core and that in the water shell is ca. 4.04 Å, which is much longer than normal O ··· O hydrogen bonds, suggesting an isolated center core in the interior of the cluster. The excess proton should be localized on the water molecule at the center, forming an unattached hydronium ion as a center core, since only ionic species could be confined individually at the crystallographic center of the cluster by the strong and specific pseudo-spherical static field applied by the MOFs. Otherwise, a neutral water molecule was hardly isolated at the center, and it would be deviated from the center to the water shell via hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, the acetonitrile molecules surrounding the protonated water clusters in the cavities were not removed at all under the dehydration conditions, probably due to the relatively small diameters of the channels that selectively allow smaller species to pass through but not acetonitrile molecules. Last, these acetonitrile molecules seem to serve as linkers to connect the large polyoxotungstate or polyoxomolybdate anions with the water clusters.\n",
      "The document states that crystalline 1NO3 is stable in water and organic solvents, and since 1NO2 maintains a similar structure to 1NO3, it can be inferred that 1NO2 is also stable in water. The document also mentions that the crystal morphology can be well retained during the anion-exchange procedure, indicating a SC–SC transformation, which suggests stability in aqueous conditions.\n",
      "In 1NO3, the nitrate anions are located in the voids of the host framework as lattice guests, so the possibility that nitrate can be replaced by other anions was probed. The anion-exchange performance of 1NO3 was illustrated by using NO2 and CF3COO as the models. Since crystalline 1NO3 is stable in water and organic solvents, we selected the appropriate single crystals of 1NO3 with similar shapes and sizes, and immersed them in a water solution of NaNO2 or NaCF3COO for anion-exchange.\n",
      "When 1 a was exposed to a natural air environment with some degree of humidity for three weeks, five cycles of CO2 adsorption isotherms at 298 K showed almost equal uptakes (Figure 8), which indicate excellent stability, which is an very important property for a MOF as CO2 adsorbent for post-combustion flue gases that contain a certain amount of moisture. This stability of 1 a differs from the rapid collapse of MOF-5 in air[42] and the decrease in CO2 loading of Mg-MOF-74 after exposure to low humidity.\n",
      "After heating of compound 1 at 300 C for 5 h, the guest water molecules were removed, and the XRPD pattern is similar to that of the original sample (Fig. S3), although minor differences can be seen in the positions, intensities, and widths of some peaks, which indicates that the framework structure remain intact after removing all water molecules.\n",
      "The PXRD patterns of the H2O, MeOH and EtOH vapor adsorption samples match quite well with the as-synthesized one, indicating that H2O/MeOH/EtOH molecules can induce the framework to deform reversibly. The high thermal stability of 1 has been demonstrated using variable temperature PXRD (VT-PXRD) experiments. The H2O adsorption profile undergoes slight and distinct steps at p 0.08 and 0.19 atm, respectively. The saturated adsorbed amount of ca. 150 cm3 g1 corresponds to 4.08 H2O molecules per formula unit, which is close to the maximum amount of 4.0 H2O molecules, as indicated by crystallographic analysis. Reversible sorption is observed as proven by the changes in relative intensities of the reflections.\n",

      "The stability of the compound in the presence of water vapor was checked. The desolvated sample was taken in a glass vial and kept in a slightly bigger screw cap bottle containing water. The PXRD of the sample was recorded after different time intervals. The framework stability was confirmed from the PXRD pattern (Figure 3). However, most MOFs, in particular zinc-based MOFs, are moisture-sensitive because the weak metal−oxygen coordination allows for attack by water molecules, resulting in the phase transformation and decomposition of the framework. Here, the water stability of this framework might be due to introducing hydrophobic functional groups like −CF3 into the framework structures, which make the framework water resistant.\n",

      "MIL-101 is stable over months under air atmosphere and was not altered when treated with various organic solvents at room temperature or under solvothermal conditions.\n",
      "The document states that UiO type structure remains intact in dilute acid and base (2 < pH < 11).\n",
      "Compound 3 exhibits an even more marked chemical stability. As shown at the bottom of Fig. 2, the structure is fully retained even after immersion in boiling water for 3 days. Boiling methanol or benzene also leave the framework intact, and no changes in peak position or intensity are visible in the associated diffraction patterns (see Fig. S10†). The unusual robustness of 3 is likely due to its double-walled framework structure, which is reminiscent of interpenetrated frameworks that are known to exhibit increased stability relative to their non-interpenetrated counterparts.5b Intriguingly, 3 is also stable in an acidic aqueous medium with pH ¼ 3 for up to 30 min at 90 C. Although some imidazolate-, triazolate-, and pyrazolate-based frameworks show extended stability in neutral or alkaline solutions,6,8,15 stability at low pH has not been reported thus far for metal–organic frameworks, and could open new opportunities for the use of these materials in acid–base catalysis.\n",
      "UTSA-16 exhibits repeatable and reversible CO2 sorption. More importantly, the re-activated UTSA-16 from the used sample, which has been exposed in the air for 3 days, still keeps the same sorption capacities for CO2, indicating that UTSA-16 is not air sensitive. Such properties are apparently important for its potential industrial usage. It needs to be mentioned that the existence of the coordinated water molecules is essential for UTSA-16 to have high CO2 capture capacity. In fact, once all the water molecules within UTSA-16 are removed at elevated temperature, the resulting anhydrous material is non-porous.\n"
