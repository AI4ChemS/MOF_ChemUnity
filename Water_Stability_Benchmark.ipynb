      "Water Stability of DUT-4 = UnstableN/A ; conditions:  ; Justification: DUT-4 also showed a type-I nitrogen physisorption isotherm (Fig. S1). Unlike HKUST-1, the water adsorption characteristics are completely different (Fig. 2). Despite its microporous structure adsorption occurs not until p/p0 = 0.4 revealing the hydrophobic character of the pores. As all aluminium ions are coordinated to oxygen atoms, there are no free coordination sites available. Additionally, the character of the non-polar, aromatic naphthalene linkers connecting the alumina-oxygen chains is highly hydrophobic. In the higher pressure region, additional adsorption occurs which is the result of condensation of water in the pores. Surprisingly, the experiment shows the opposite behavior of hysteresis. The desorption branch falls below the adsorption branch. We assume that this is due to partial decomposition of the framework during adsorption in the higher pressure region resulting in a higher water uptake. This water is then desorbed from a new solid phase with different water-surface interaction of lower binding strength leading to the steep decline of the desorption isotherm. A second measurement of the water sorption isotherms on the same sample confirmed this assumption as it revealed a similar shape of the isotherm, but the isotherms can not be superimposed. To analyze the water stability, the material was heated in water at 323 K for 24 h. The XRD powder pattern (Fig. S3) confirmed the partial decomposition of DUT-4, since the reflections are partly shifted and the amorphous background increased. Apparently, the material is stable at ambient atmosphere but direct contact with water leads to gradual decomposition.\n",

For example, it was reported that UiO-67 (Scheme 1)—a MOF isoreticular with UiO-66, but containing extended biphenyl dicarboxylate (bpdc) linkers—is not stable to H2O exposure.8,9 This lack of stability was attributed to linker hydrolysis engendered by clustering of H2O molecules near the Zr6-based node (a phenomenon observed for other carboxylate containing MOFs10) and rotational effects of the extended linker.8\" \"Activation directly from H2O (red triangles) leads to a complete loss of porosity.\" \"Rather than hydrolytic instability through H2O clustering, our data demonstrate instability arises from the presence of capillary forces experienced during activation.\"\n",

NU-1000 has triangular micropores as well as exceptionally large mesopores (ca. 30 Å diameter). In this regard, NU-1000 should facilitate the permeation of H2O throughout its structure and ensure H2O molecules can readily access its node. Examination of the PXRD patterns of NU-1000 soaked in H2O for 24 h but not activated, activated directly from H2O, and solvent-exchanged to acetone followed by thermal activation reveal that the crystallinity is maintained except when NU-1000 is activated directly from H2O. In particular the reflections centered at 5 and 7.5 degrees have broadened, while the peaks at higher angles have decreased in intensity. Consistent with the UiO-67 sample, N2 adsorption isotherms demonstrate that the sample activated directly from H2O exhibits significantly less porosity than either the pristine NU-1000 sample or the one activated via solvent-exchange. For example, the BET surface area of the sample activated from H2O is 480 m2 g1, while pristine NU-1000 has a surface area of 2040 m2 g1.\"\n",

Both the parent and functionalized UiO-66 show good structural stability via complete PXRD peak agreement and negligible BET surface area loss. This is attributed to the higher stability of the Zr inorganic cluster. The adsorption behavior of UiO-66 and DMOF-1 are analogous to pore filling in heterogeneous pore spaces of mesoporous silicas and carbons. MOFs with openmetal sites strongly bind water and exhibit isotherm shapes similar to zeolites 5A and 13X. These MOFs are difficult to regenerate after water exposure by heating under vacuum. PXRD patterns suggest that the crystalline structures are retained to some extent, but BET surface areas of the materials decreased substantially and are indicative of some structure loss during the adsorption-reactivation process likely due to the use of dry air as the carrier gas. Oxygen exposure itself or the presence of entrained oxygen in the adsorbed water phase may facilitate the degradation. This work provides a systematic investigation of water adsorption in prototypical MOFs and shows that in some cases these materials display water adsorption behavior that is comparable to conventional adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbon. Nevertheless, additional studies of water adsorption in MOFs for a wide range of metals and ligands are necessary to truly develop design criteria for synthesizing water-stable materials.\n",

      "Water Stability = UnstableN/A ; conditions:  ; Justification: The amine-functionalized and parent forms of DMOF-1 also exhibited a complete loss of crystallinity after water exposure at 90% RH. Both the parent and functionalized UiO-66 show good structural stability via complete PXRD peak agreement and negligible BET surface area loss. This is attributed to the higher stability of the Zr inorganic cluster. The adsorption behavior of UiO-66 and DMOF-1 are analogous to pore filling in heterogeneous pore spaces of mesoporous silicas and carbons. MOFs with openmetal sites strongly bind water and exhibit isotherm shapes similar to zeolites 5A and 13X. These MOFs are difficult to regenerate after water exposure by heating under vacuum. PXRD patterns suggest that the crystalline structures are retained to some extent, but BET surface areas of the materials decreased substantially and are indicative of some structure loss during the adsorption-reactivation process likely due to the use of dry air as the carrier gas. Oxygen exposure itself or the presence of entrained oxygen in the adsorbed water phase may facilitate the degradation. This work provides a systematic investigation of water adsorption in prototypical MOFs and shows that in some cases these materials display water adsorption behavior that is comparable to conventional adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbon. Nevertheless, additional studies of water adsorption in MOFs for a wide range of metals and ligands are necessary to truly develop design criteria for synthesizing water-stable materials.\n",

This instability is attributed to the fourcoordinated zinc-carboxylate system. The hydrolysis degradation reaction appears to describe the UMCM-1 structure loss; at higher values of 2Θ, there is evidence of Zn(OH)2, which is a direct product of this reaction. The degradation of UMCM-1 is not surprising considering that the coordination environment is identical to MOF-5, which is well-known to decompose under humid conditions.\n",

The desolvated sample was taken in a glass vial and kept in a slightly bigger screw cap bottle containing water. The PXRD of the sample was recorded after different time intervals. The framework stability was confirmed from the PXRD pattern (Figure 3). However, most MOFs, in particular zinc-based MOFs, are moisture-sensitive because the weak metal−oxygen coordination allows for attack by water molecules, resulting in the phase transformation and decomposition of the framework. Here, the water stability of this framework might be due to introducing hydrophobic functional groups like −CF3 into the framework structures, which make the framework water resistant. The run of the water vapor physisorption isotherm reflects a very hydrophobic surface of 1. The significant uptake can be reached only at a high relative humidity level (p/p0 > 0.9; Figure 18). This outperforms even activated carbon, known to have a hydrophobic surface.\n",

While the open-metal sites are known to interact favorably with CO2, the interaction with water is even more favorable. As a result, water will typically adsorb preferentially over CO2 in MOFs with open-metal sites, leading to lower adsorption capacity for CO2. Thus, limiting or preventing water uptake will improve the selectivity and capacity of the MOF for CO2. The water isotherms for HKUST-1, CuMBTC, and CuEBTC are shown in Figure 8.

Following water vapor sorption, there was no change in the PXRD pattern (Figure S8) and only a 2% reduction in N2 uptake at 77 K (Figure S1). To test the stability further, higher temperatures were employed. CALF-25 was exposed for 24 h to 90% relative humidity at 353 K, corresponding to a water partial pressure of 426.7 mbar. This treatment also gave no changes in the PXRD pattern. The retention of crystallinity and porosity of CALF-25 at 273 K after exposure to humid conditions suggests that the material is stable toward water vapor. While CALF-25 is stable toward water vapor at 353 K, boiling the MOF in water caused a significant loss in crystallinity (Figure S9), a partial phase change, and partial solubilization of the material, suggesting that the water vapor stability is due to a kinetic protective effect of the ethyl groups within the pores.\n",

Compound 1 represents a rare example of a MOF with open channels that form/collapse reversibly upon hydration/dehydration. It can be used as a desiccant that adsorbs water molecules very selectively. Compared to traditional molecular sieves that are widely used as desiccants for organic solvents, 1 possesses the following advantages: first, the adsorbed water molecules can be removed under relatively lower temperatures and, second, 1 can selectively adsorb water molecules over organic solvents.\n",

The high CO2 selectivity over other gases and water stability makes the compound promising candidate for industrial postcombustion gas separation application. Removal of guest water was confirmed by TGA, and framework stability was confirmed from PXRD pattern. Desolvated compound is stable in open air even after months. To check the water stability of the framework, we kept compound 1A in a closed vessel exposed to water vapor for 24 h at 60 °C. TGA data indicates that the water exposed phase takes ∼10% H2O and PXRD pattern remains unchanged, indicating compound maintains the framework. This compound also maintains the framework after dehydrating the exposed phase, which was again confirmed from TGA, PXRD, and CO2 sorption data.\n",
