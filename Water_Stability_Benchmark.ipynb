      "water stability = Stable ; conditions: Immersion in water, exposure to air, and heating ; Justification: Interestingly, brief immersion of single crystal 2 into water or exposure to air for several days results in complete rehydration and formation of hydrated crystal [Cu(4-pmpmd)-(H2O)2(opd)·2H2O}]n (3), including two coordinated water molecules and three guest water molecules. Thus, the rehydration process is accompanied by return of the original blue color. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination of 3 revealed that the crystal system and space group remain the same as those of 2, but the copper center has re-form from a square planar (as in 2) to an octahedral coordination environment, owing to the introduction of coordinated water molecules. The TG profile of 3 also exhibits a stepwise release and shows that all the coordinated and uncoordinated water molecules are lost at 80 °C (calcd, 10.0%; found, 9.8%) (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Thus, heating 3 to 110 °C for 2 h completely reverses the structural change, and the original material 2 is reconstituted after the removal of all the water molecules.\n",

      "- \"Finally, we find that MOF-801-P, MOF-802, MOF-841, UiO-66, CAU-10, and MCM-41 exhibit the best and closest to the ideal cycling performance. These materials show robust cycling performance as indicated by the similarity of water uptake in all five cycles (Figure 7). Since these materials are stable under humid conditions and have no strong binding sites (e.g., open metal sites) for water to bind, it is expected their working capacity (deliverable amount of water) not to be strongly influenced by the regeneration conditions.\"\n",

      "- \"At P/P0 = 0.1, the water uptakes of MOF-801-P and Co-MOF74 are higher than 20 wt %, which outperform any of the other MOFs. More importantly, after the first cycle these capacities are still 3 times greater than that of zeolite 13X, which is commonly used for water adsorption chillers.29 The water uptake capacity increases for all materials at P/P0 = 0.3. However, the order is slightly different from the one observed at relative pressure of 0.1: here, MOF-841 outperforms other materials. The isotherm profile of this material (Figure 6b), which shows a significant step in the pressure range from P/P0 = 0.2 to 0.3, indicates that water rapidly condenses in the pore of this MOF at this pressure range. In addition, the uptake is nearly constant throughout the five cycles. After the fifth cycle, the uptake is still greater than 40 wt %.\"\n",
