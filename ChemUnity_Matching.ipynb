      "Metal–organic coordination polymers with open frameworks (porous coordination polymers: PCPs) have been an area of intense research due to their rich structural chemistry and potential applications in storage, catalysis and separation processes.1 Generally porous solids with a pore diameter of less than 2 nm are microporous and those in the range from 2 to 50 nm are mesoporous materials.2 Although the immense variety of reports on PCPs has been updated in recent years, in fact, almost all structures cover the microporous region with pore diameters of less than 1 nm and there are still few guidelines to create an extra-large microporous or mesoporous framework with a pore diameter of 41.5 nm, because ligand extension is often accompanied by thermal unstability or framework interpenetration. The large micropores with complete crystalline pore walls have been desired because of their functional significance for high performance catalysis, the separation of large molecules and also as drug delivery systems.3 The crystalline extra-large microporous solids have been limited to inorganic motifs such as silicates or phosphates,4 and recently a couple of reports on the creation of PCPs with large pore diameters have been observed.5 It is well known that the paddle-wheel type cluster M2(COO)4 with a bicarboxylate and an N-donor linker affords 3D porous networks with high thermal stability.6 The coordination geometry of the equatorial and axial positions of the cluster provides a square grid type open framework with high designability. Herein we present a new synthetic approach for an extra-large microporous framework\n",

      "The crystal structure of 1H2O around the Cu2+ center is shown in Fig. 1a.y The asymmetric unit consists of one Cu2+, 4-bcba-H and a guest water molecule. The equatorial position of the Cu2+ ion in the paddle-wheel cluster is coordinated to the carboxylate group and the axial position is occupied by N atoms of the amine group of 4-bcba-H. The ligands are bending to connect each Cu2+ dimer to form 1D chains along the c axis and the chains are linked via another carboxy-benzyl group to construct a robust 3D framework (Fig. 1b). As a result, the structure of 1H2O has two kinds of straight 1D channels which are large and hexagonal with dimensions of 14.3 - 13.2 A˚ 2 and triangular with dimensions of 3.3 - 4.2 A˚ 2, both along the c axis. This network on the ab plane is a Kagome´-type structure7 and the pore diameter of B15 A˚ is in the range of an extra-large micropore. The estimated solventaccessible void volume is 63.9% of the total crystal volume by PLATON program.8 Evacuation procedure at 140 1C for 1*H2O provided the dehydrated sample of 1. The thermal stability of 1 was checked\n",

We also measured variable temperature X-ray powder patterns for 1 (Fig. 3). In the range of 90 to 400 K, the powder patterns show sharp peaks and do not change at all, matching the simulation from single crystal X-ray analysis. This indicates that the porous framework possesses high crystallinity and robustness over a wide range of temperatures.\n",

The adsorption amount is 500 mL g1 (STP) at P/P0=0.9 and the desorption profile does not show any hysteresis and the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area of 1 calculated from the N2 adsorption isotherm is 1715 m2 g1 (Fig. 5a).w The small triangular pore is too narrow to pass gases and only the\n",

      "1 for each temperature (l = 0.8 A˚ ). hexagonal pore acts as a gas accommodation channel. The pore size distribution of 1, which was calculated by DFT methods in Fig. 5b, showed a pore diameter of only 15 A˚ dominating the distribution, which is consistent with the crystallographic results of large hexagonal 1D channels.w The adsorption isotherms of guests are dependent on the shape and intramolecular interaction of the guests at each temperature. In the case of CO2, the isotherm at 195 K in Fig. 4b shows a type IV isotherm with no hysteresis loop. The pore filling with multilayers of adsorptive molecules causes sharp capillary condensation observed at P/P0 from 0.21 to 0.23 which indicates a narrow distribution of pores in the mesoscale range. The absence of hysteresis during desorption is a common feature of materials containing hexagonally aligned 1-D pores with widths of o40 A˚ .\n",
      "\n",
      "9 For MeOH and MeCN (Fig. 4c and d) at 298 K, we also have type-IV isotherms without hysteresis. The relative pressure of capillary condensation of MeOH (P/P0 = 0.22) is larger than that of MeCN and the saturated adsorption amount of MeOH is also larger than for MeCN. The extra-large micropores of 1 with high crystallinity provide the different adsorption profiles which are dependent on both the chemical and physical properties of the guest molecule.\n",
