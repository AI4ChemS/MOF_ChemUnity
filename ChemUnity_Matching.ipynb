Crystals of the title compound (I) consist of tris-chelate molecules of the complex [CO(SECNMe2)a]. Three dithiocarbamate ligands octahedrally coordinate to a Co atom through S atoms. The bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. A perspective view of the molecule is presented in Fig. 1. The molecule assumes 32 symmetry to a good approximation. The dimensions within the ligands are normal. The Co atom lies nearly in the plane of each ligand, the deviations being 0.18 (3), 0.02 (1) and 0.05 (1) /k for the three ligands respectively. The geometry of the CoS 6 part of the molecule is similar to those of [Co(SECNH2) 3] (II) (Raston, White & Willis, 1975) and [Co(SECNEt2) a] (III) (Merlino, 1968), and is intermediate between (II) and (III). The mean Co-S Acta Cryst. (1980). B36, 1659-1662 distances are 2.275, 2-264 and 2.258 A for (II), (I) and (III) respectively. The molecules of (III) lie on crystallographic twofold axes, and hence the two Co-S lengths in each ligand are equal. In (II), one Co-S bond is significantly shorter than the other, the mean difference being 0.020/k, and these three short bonds are related by the approximate threefold axis of the molecule. The corresponding difference in (I) is 0-013 A. In this case, however, the shorter bonds are not related by the approximate threefold axis, and, therefore, the present molecule by no means has strict trigonal symmetry. As Raston et al. (1975) have suggested, the difference between the two Co-S distances within a ligand might result from the difference of the sulfur environment, but a close correlation between Co-S distances and intermolecular S-H interactions as reported for (II) could not be found in the present case. Relatively short intermolecular contacts of 2.8 (1)-3.0(1) A are observed for S(2)...H(71), S(3)...H(43), S(4)...H(93) and S(5)...H(42), though the H positions have been less accurately determined.')]\n",

Two types of coordinated cadmium cations exist in the structure. One is located on a twofold axis and is coordinated by four O and two N atoms from four symmetry-related ligands, forming a trigonal-prismatic coordination polyhedron. The other is located on an inversion center and is octahedrally coordinated by two N and two O atoms from two ligands in equatorial sites, and two water molecules in axial sites. The organic ligand bridges three Cd atoms, through a carboxylate group and two N atoms of the tetrazolate unit. This mode of coordination results in a two-dimensional framework.

The overall architecture is a twofold interpenetrated CdSO4-type framework. The two crystallographically equivalent frameworks are linked by O— HO hydrogen bonds between the water, hydroxy and carboxylate groups.\\n\\nComment\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Comment\\n\\nThe design and synthesis of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been an area of rapid growth in recent years owing to the potential applications of MOFs in nonlinear optics, luminescence, magnetism, catalysis, gas absorption, ion exchange and as zeolite-like materials for molecular selection (O'Keeffe et al., 2008). Structural diversity in MOFs can occur as a result of various processes, including supramolecular isomerism, interpenetration or interweaving (Batten & Robson, 1998; Batten, 2001). Ideally, the topologies of MOFs can be controlled and modified by the coordination geometry preferred by the metal ion and the chemical structure of the organic ligand chosen (Abrahams et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2008). In this regard, rigid N-donor 4,40-bipyridine (bipy) and its derivatives have been studied in the construction of MOFs (Qiao et al., 2008). So far, a number of MOFs based on bipy and its derivatives have been reported, including one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional layers and three-dimensional frameworks (Carlucci et al., 2003). However, reports of MOFs constructed by flexible N-donor ligands are relatively rare (Wang et al., 2006). Among such ligands, bis(imidazole) derivatives are a good choice (Yang et al., 2008), leading to some intriguing interpenetrating architectures and topologies (Wang et al., 2006). In this work, we chose 5-hydroxybenzene1,3-dicarboxylic acid (5-OH-1,3-H2bdc) as a dicarboxylate ligand and 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (1,4-bix) as a flexible N-donor ligand, yielding a new coordination polymer, [Cd(5-OH-1,3-bdc)(1,4-bix)(H2O)], (I), with a fascinating twofold interpenetrated three-dimensional CdSO4-like framework. After the acceptance of this paper, we noticed that the structure of (I) has recently been described by Xia et al. (2011).

The N atoms occupy the axial sites and the O atoms occupy the equatorial sites of the bipyramid. The Cd—Ocarboxylate distances (Table 1) are comparable to those observed in [Cd(1,4-bdc)(bpdo)(H2O)]n (1,4-bdc is benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate and bpdo is 4,40-bipyridine N,N0-dioxide; Xu & Xie, 2010).\\n\\nFigure 1 A view of the local coordination of the CdII atom in (I), showing the atom-numbering scheme.

Therefore, on the basis of the concept of chemical topology, the overall structure of (I) is a four-connected framework with the Schla¨fli symbol of 658. Topological analysis reveals that this three-dimensional framework is a typical CdSO4 net. Interestingly, the large spaces in the single three-dimensional framework allow another identical framework to interpenetrate it, providing a twofold interpenetrating CdSO4 framework (Fig. 3). Each CdSO4 net is hydrogen bonded to its neighbour through O— H-O hydrogen bonds among the water molecules, hydroxy group and carboxylate O atoms (Table 2).\\n\\nSo far, some related interpenetrated CdSO4-like MOFs based on both dicarboxylate and flexible N-donor bridging ligands have been reported. The structure of [Zn2(1,4bdc)Cl2(bpp)]n [1,4-bdc is benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate and bpp is 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane; Zhang et al., 2006] also contains two crystallographically equivalent nets, but differs from (I) in that the four-connected nodes are based on ZnII dimers rather than mononuclear complexes. [Zn(mip)(bpa)]n [mip is 5-methylisophthalate and bpa is 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane; Ma et al., 2009] shows an unusual threefold interpenetrated CdSO4 topology. [Ni(oba)(bbi)]2H2O [oba is 4,40-oxybis- (benzoate) and bbi is 1,10-(1,4-butanediyl)bis(imidazole); Yang et al., 2009] also shows twofold interpenetrated nets as in (I); however, the nets are crystallographically distinct.\\n\\nExperimental'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Experimental\\n\\nA mixture of CdCl22.5H2O (0.5 mmol), 1,4-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)- benzene (0.5 mmol), 5-hydroxybenzene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (0.5 mmol) and water (12 ml) was sealed in a 23 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel Parr bomb.

The chains are interconnected by BDC linkers, generating a three-dimensional framework with large voids. The Eu atoms are coordinated by seven carboxylate O atoms and one solvent O atom in a sterically constrained manner due to the carboxylate group rigidity, and this causes the coordination to be distorted dodecahedral. The ethyl groups of the solvent ligand are disordered in the void. The elongated Eu—O bond to the solvent indicates that it is loosely bound to the framework, and hence solvent exchange may be possible. In the void there is additionally one partly occupied disordered water molecule.\\n\\nComment\\n\\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great scientific'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Comment\\n\\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great scientific\\n\\ninterest (Kitahawa et al., 2004; Lu, 2003; O'Keeffe et al., 2000). Their potential use in gas storage has attracted enormous attention worldwide. The main research activity in our group has focused on the magnetic properties of these compounds (Poulsen, Bentien et al., 2005). The present structure, (I), is one in a series of MOFs which may combine interesting magnetic effects and potential gas storage due to the electronrich metal centers.

Displacement ellipsoids are shown at the 50% probability level.\\n\\nFigure 2 The packing of the structure, viewed along the c axis of the unit cell.\\n\\nEu atoms are connected by carboxylate groups of the deprotonated terephthalate ligands, generating chains of metal atoms. These chains are interconnected by the terephthalate ligands, resulting in a three-dimensional network. The intra-chain EuEu distance is alternately 4.034 (2) and 5.572 (4) A˚ , whereas the inter-chain distance is much larger (> 9.6 A˚ ). This could lead to a unique magnetic direction along the c axis of the unit cell.\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The short intra-chain distance has four bridging carboxylate groups and two direct -bridging O atoms (O12). The bridging atom has one short [Eu—O = 2.4007 (15) A˚ ] and one long [Eu—O = 2.7884 (18) A˚ ] bond to the Eu atoms. Excluding the longer bridging bond, the bond length average from the carboxylate O atoms to the Eu atom, hEu—O(carboxylate)i, is 2.353 (2) A˚ . This average is smaller than the bond length to the diethyl formamide molecule, hEu—O(DEF)i = 2.436 (6) A˚ , hence this molecule is more weakly bonded and could be subject to solvent exchange. Because of the sterically constrained carboxylate groups, the coordination of the Eu atoms is distorted dodecahedral.\\n\\nA slight degree of electron localization is observed in the carboxylate group bridging the long Eu-Eu distance, while the others are delocalized. A carboxylate group has a net charge of 1e, and a formal electron count suggests that the Eu atom has a charge of +3, which is in agreement with the synthesis conditions.\\n\\nThe voids of the network are occupied by disordered solvent molecules [0.525 (3):0.475 (3)], which are directly bonded to the Eu atoms. The bonding of solvent to the framework metal center was previously reported in Mn-based systems (Poulsen et al., 2004; Poulsen, Bentien et al., 2005).\\n\\nA partially occupied water molecule [0.350 (8)], which is disordered over two equivalent crystallographic positions, also occupies the void. The large displacement parameter observed for atom C19B could mask disorder related to hydrogen bonding to the partly occupied water molecule, O99.\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nThe title compound was prepared by adding a mixture of EuCl36H2O (1.0 mmol, 0.366 g) and DEF (3 ml) to a mixture of benzene-1,4dicarboxylic acid, H2BDC (1 mmol, 0.166 g), and DEF (7 ml) in an autoclave.

In terms of geometric parameters, the most notable difference between the coordination geometries in the two independent polymers is found in the Ni—S bond distances, with a more symmetric mode of coordination being noted for the S1,S2-containing ligand (Figs 1 and 2; Table 1).

The Cu atom and the C and O atoms of the succinate ligands lie on a mirror plane. Two adjacent CuO4N2 octahedra share one common O–O edge, forming a Cu2O6N4 bioctahedron with a CuCu separation of 3.524 (2) A˚ . Neighboring bioctahedra are connected by bisunidentate succinate anions in the a-axis direction, while in the c-axis direction bioctahedra are connected by bis-bidentate succinate anions, leading to an infinite two-dimensional network structure. These networks are further connected along the a-axis direction by hydrogen bonds between ammonia ligands and carboxylate O atoms of neighboring network layers, forming a three-dimensional lamellar structure.\\n\\nRelated Literature\\n\\nFor related literature, see: Halcrow (2001); Holm et al.

The chain structure is constructed from '4+1' square-pyramidally coordinated copper(II) atoms bonded to chelating phenanthroline (phen) ligands and linked through 1,3phenyldihydrogendiphosphonate ligands. The basal plane of the Cu(II) site is defined by the phen nitrogen donors and phosphonate oxygen atoms from two diphosphonate ligands, while the apical position is occupied by an oxygen donor from a third diphosphonate ligand. The chains propagate along the a-axis direction. Inversion-related phen groups engage in - stacking with a mean distance of 3.376 (2) A˚ between the ring planes.

Both water molecule H atoms participate in normal-strength hydrogen bonds to carboxylate O atoms. Quantum chemical calculations (using CASTEP)  were  used  to  determine  the  H-atom positions and analyze the hydrogen bonding and the metal coordination. Both the atomic charges and the MÐO bond overlap populations indicate that, despite the fact that these compounds are isostructural, the metal±terephthalate bonding is different. The bonding in the Mg complex is essentially ionic, while the MÐO bonds in the Mn, Fe and Co complexes have signi®cant covalent character. Comparison of a new Rietveld re®nement of the structure of copper(II) terephtha late  trihydrate  with the  reported  single-crystal  structure provides an opportunity to assess the accuracy and precision that can be expected from structures of aromatic carboxylates determined using X-ray powder data.

Introduction Puri®ed terephthalic acid (PTA, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) is the primary and preferred raw material for the polyester used to make a myriad of consumer and industrial products. BP Chemicals technology produces over 3  109 kg  of PTA per year. A feed mix of p-xylene, catalyst and acetic acid is oxidized with air in a continuous homogeneous reactor, where crude terephthalic acid (TA) is produced (Barker & Saffer, 1958; Partenheimer, 1995). Puri®ed terephthalic acid is then obtained through heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation and crystallization (Meyer, 1971). From time to time, terephthalate salts are isolated from process streams. Understanding the natures of terephthalate complexes of catalyst and corrosion metals should lead to process insights and improvements.

The octahedra are isolated; the equatorial coordination consists of four terephthalate O atoms and there are two axial water molecules (Fig. 5). The cation valences, calculated from the sums of bond valences (Brese & Figure 4 The crystal structure of M(C8H4O4)(H2O)2 viewed down the b axis.\\n\\nare represented by 50% probability spheroids and H atoms by circles of arbitrary radius.\\n\\nO0Keefe, 1991), are 2.04, 2.02, 2.35 and 1.97 for Mg, Mn, Fe and Co, respectively. The lower stability of the Fe complex is consistent with its high valence.\\n\\nThe bond distances fall within the normal ranges (they were subject to soft constraints). A search of the Cambridge Structural Database (Allen & Kennard, 1993) for aromatic carboxylates that bridge two metal atoms yielded reasonable populations for Mn, Fe and Co (Table 2) but none for Mg. Both these values and those calculated using the bond-valence formalism can be used to assess the re®ned MÐO distances. Both MnÐcarboxylate and CoÐcarboxylate distances are shorter than those of general MO6 coordination spheres, while the FeÐcarboxylate distances are larger. The deviations of the OÐMÐO angles from the ideal octahedral angles are small, except for Co, in which the equatorial angles are 101 and 79.\\n\\nThe bond distances and angles of the carboxylate groups of the terephthalate anions were subject to soft constraints, so they fall within the normal ranges. (The soft constraints accounted for only a few percent of the ®nal reduced 2.) The CÐO bonds are equal in length and resonant; because they bridge two metal atoms, this is reasonable. The carboxylate in the Co complex is decidedly non-planar (the sum of the angles around C11 is 354.0).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"None of the terephthalate anions are completely planar; the carboxylates are rotated approximately 10 out of the ring plane.

The angle between successive ring planes in the stack is 8.0 in the Mg complex. The densities of these complexes are not exceptionally high (Mg = 1.709, Mn = 1.878, Fe = 1.937, Co = 1.996 g mlÿ1) and theside-toside' packing of the terephthalates is relatively `loose' (supplementary material). There is a signi®cant volume that could be occupied by probes of 0.8±1.0 AÊ radius. Apparently, the coordination interactions are more important than the packing of the aromatic anions in determining the crystal structure.

In zinc terephthalate dihydrate (Guilera & Steed, 1999), the zinc coordination is tetrahedral and each carboxyl is monodentate. Just as in the current structures, each water-molecule H atom participates in a hydrogen bond in these two structures.\\n\\n3.2. Comparison Of Refined And Optimized Structures And Bonding In The Complexes\\n\\nIn general, the agreement between the Rietveld-re®ned and the CASTEP-optimized structures is good. The weighted r.m.s. deviations between the atom positions are 0.054 (Mg), 0.154 (Mn), 0.202 (Fe) and 0.204 AÊ (Co) for the 12 atoms of the asymmetric unit. The agreement of the deviations among the non-H atoms is better: 0.030 (Mg), 0.107 (Mn), 0.149 (Fe) and 0.157 AÊ (Co). Because the Mg structure is by far the best determined (the re®nement included two synchrotron powder patterns) and this compound contains no unpaired electrons, this trend is reasonable. Since the Mn, Fe and Co structures were re®ned using only laboratory data, the optimized structures for these metals may be better than the experimental structures. In the optimized Mn structure, the MnÐO bond distances are much closer to those expected from an analysis of MnÐcarboxylate distances in the CSD (Table 2). In the optimized Co structure, the CoÐO12 distance has become very long (2.308 AÊ ). In all four optimized structures, the carboxylate groups are planar and the OÐMÐO angles are closer to the ideal octahedral values; the optimized structures are more chemically reasonable.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='All of the bond distances, angles, charges and overlap populations in the terephthalate ions indicate that the terephthalates in these four compounds are essentially identical; the differences lie in the metal±terephthalate and hydrogen bonding.\\n\\nBoth the atomic charges (Fig. 6) and the MÐO bondoverlap populations (Fig. 7 and Table 2) indicate that, despite the fact that these compounds are isostructural, the metal± terephthalate bonding is different.

The quantum calculations demonstrate, however, that both H16 and H17 form hydrogen bonds to O12 in the Mn, Fe and Co complexes (Table 4). In magnesium terephthalate dihydrate, H16 forms hydrogen bonds to both O12 and O13. The carboxyl O atom O13 does not serve as a hydrogen-bond acceptor in the transition metal complexes. Although O13 is less negatively charged than O12 (Fig. 6), the hydrogen bonds are clearly more than just electrostatic interactions. Other than the covalent bonds, the only other positive overlap populations represent the hydrogen bonds (Table 4). The overlap population of the water-molecule covalent OÐH bonds varies from 0.5±0.6 electrons in these complexes. Because such a bond has a dissociation energy of 490 kJ molÿ1, even the overlap populations of 0.03±0.10 electrons in the OH hydrogen bonds correspond to considerable attraction energy. In the Co complex, the H16O12 hydrogen bond is much stronger than the others, correlated to the long CoÐO12 distance in this complex. The coordination and hydrogen-bond interactions are the most important in determining the structures of these complexes.\\n\\n3.3. Copper(Ii) Terephthalate Trihydrate\\n\\nThe crystal structure of catena-[diaqua(2-terephthalato- O,O0)copper(II) dihydrate], or copper terephthalate trihydrate, has been reported (Cueto et al., 1991; Deakin et al., 1999) as a high-quality single-crystal re®nement.

As expected, the lattice parameters are determined more precisely using high-quality powder data. The estimated standard uncertainties on the coordinates from the Rietveld re®nement are a factor of three larger than those from the single-crystal re®nement; the slope of the normal probability plot indicates that these standard uncertainties are underestimated by almost a factor of two. The displacement coef®cients are less well determined using a single laboratory X-ray powder data set.\\n\\nThe average difference between the bond distances in the two structures is 0.03 AÊ and the average difference in bond angles is only 1.1.

The largest difference is in the Cu15ÐO16 distance to the coordinated water molecule. This accuracy and precision is comparable to that observed in a similar comparison of cobalt acetate tetrahydrate re®nements (Kaduk & Partenheimer, 1997) and demonstrates that suf®cient accuracy and precision to answer chemical questions can reasonably be expected from Rietveld re®nements.

The compound has a distorted trigonal–planar coordination geometry around the AgI ion, with each ligand bridging three AgI ions to form a one-dimensional strand of molecules parallel to the b axis. An extensive hydrogen-bond pattern connects these strands to form a three-dimensional network of mog topology.\\n\\nComment\\n\\nThe design of metal coordination polymers has attracted considerable interest, particularly with respect to supramolecular chemistry. The choice of ligands coordinated to the metal centres is often the most important factor (Batten et al., 2009). We attempted to synthesize a new silver(I) compound with high dimensionality using the N:N0-bridging ligand pyrazine-2,3-dicarbonitrile, but unexpectedly obtained the title silver(I) compound, (I), with the ligand 3-aminocarbonylpyrazine-2-carboxylate (pyzca).\\n\\nPyzca is an intermediate compound formed during hydrol-\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Pyzca is an intermediate compound formed during hydrol-\\n\\nysis of the corresponding dicarboxamide to the dicarboxylic acid. Only two structures containing this ligand were found in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD, updated August 2010; Allen, 2002): [Ni(pyzca)2(H2O)2]H2O was obtained upon hydrolysis of pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxamide catalysed by Ni(NO3)2 (Heyn & Dietzel, 2007), while [Co(tren)(pyzca)]- (ClO4)Cl [where tren is tris(2-aminoethyl)amine] (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2009) was obtained via direct reaction of the pyzca ligand with [Co(tren)Cl2]Cl and NaClO4 in water. In both these monomeric compounds, pyzca acts as an N,O- chelating ligand. Compound (I) is the first coordination polymer obtained from partial hydrolysis of pyrazine-2,3dicarbonitrile in an aqueous medium. The reaction was relatively slow, catalysed by AgNO3 (Heyn & Dietzel, 2007) as a Lewis acid, and hence only a few crystals were formed.\\n\\nA search of the CSD revealed no structures containing the commercially available pyrazine-2,3-dicarbonitrile (the starting ligand), i.e. not even the structure of the ligand has yet been determined. For pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxamide, four CuII structures (Mondal & Ray, 1977; Klein et al., 1983) with the ligand in an N,O-chelating mode and one AgI structure (Massoud et al., 2009) with the ligand in an N:N0-bridging mode have been reported. In contrast, many compounds of pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid with alkali (Tombul et al., 2006, 2007; Tombul, Gu¨ ven & Bu¨ yu¨kgu¨ngo¨r, 2008; Tombul, Gu¨ ven & Svoboda, 2008; Tombul & Guven, 2009) and transition metals (Zou et al., 1998, 1999; Konar et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2008) have been synthesized and structurally characterized.\\n\\nThe structure and atom-numbering scheme for (I) are shown in Fig. 1.

The hydrogen bonds between opposite amide groups (N82—H82A-O81iii; symmetry codes as in Fig. 2) form inversion-symmetric eight-membered rings, with a graph-set symbol (Bernstein et al., 1995) of R22(8), extending the structure to form a two-dimensional sheet (Fig. 2a). The plane of the strands is (102), whereas the sheets lie parallel to (101). Almost perpendicular to this strong and well known supramolecular synthon we find a three-centre amide–pyrazine hydrogen-bond system forming eight- (N82— H82B-O81iv) and ten-membered rings (N82—H82B-N4v) with graph-set symbols of R22(8) and R22(10), respectively, which further extends the structure to form a three-dimensional network (Fig. 2b).\\n\\nOften a clearer description and better understanding of such a structure can be obtained by network analysis, a concept introduced by Wells (1954, 1977) and further developed by O'Keeffe and others (O'Keeffe & Hyde, 1996). Recently, we have successfully used this technique on a number of hydrogen-bonded systems (Abu-Youssef et al., 2006; Johansson et al., 2007; Wallentin et al., 2009). Briefly, the method involves finding the topology symbol [a three letter code, often preceded by the point symbol (or Schla¨fli symbol) of the net, describing the number of different rings (O'Keeffe et al., 2010; Blatov et al., 2010)] of the three-dimensional net, and this then gives a reduced, and often informative, description of the structure. The structures can thus, in many cases, be related to a small number of high-symmetry nets (Ockwig et al., 2005) found from geometric considerations or from inorganic-type structures and minerals.\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The first step in such an analysis is to assign nodes, and in this case the Ag eight-membered ring in the one-dimensional strand is an obvious choice as it clearly connects to four different ligands. For further analysis of the hydrogen-bond connectivities, simplicity is one of the main guidelines; a net with high symmetry that contributes to the understanding of the structure is better than a complicated multinodal net that might not even have been recorded previously. Thus, we consider the strong double N82—H82A-O81iii hydrogen bonds and the likewise strong double N82—H82B-N4v hydrogen bonds as forming the links between the ligands and two Ag dimeric nodes, and two other ligands giving a network with two different four-connected vertices. In doing so, we ignore not only the intramolecular N82—H82B-N4 hydrogen bonds but also the N82—H82B-O81iv interaction.\\n\\nThe latter is clearly much weaker than the N82— H82A-O81iii hydrogen bond of the same type, and, considering the larger covalent radius of N compared with O (Bondi, 1964), also weaker than the N82—H82B-N4v interaction.\\n\\nHowever, more importantly, this interaction does not connect two ligands to each other; instead, it forms a double hydrogen-\\n\\nbond motif connecting four ligands. Thus, a network description incorporating this intermolecular bond as well would give a complicated three-nodal net and we would not gain anything in terms of describing or understanding the structure.\\n\\nThe complete assignment, shown in the scheme above, gives\\n\\nthree- and four-connected nets.

The water molecule forms hydrogen bonds to carboxylate groups.\\n\\nComment\\n\\nThere has been tremendous interest in the syntheses and crystal structures of open-framework materials due to their potential applications in catalysis, separation and ion exchange processes (Eddaoudi et al., 2001). As functional metal centres, lanthanide metals have received intense attention because of their physical and chemical properties. So far, extensive work has been carried out using carboxylatecontaining ligands, such as benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid, trimesic acid, benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid and naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (Liu et al., 2004). Benzene-1,4dicarboxylic acid (1,4-H2BDC) seems to be a promising organic linker because two carboxyl groups are able to establish bridges between several metal centres through various coordination modes and the conjugation with the aromatic ring allows it to become a rigid linker. Compared with transition metals, the analogous lanthanide complexes containing 1,4-BDC are still undeveloped, though some lanthanide coordination polymers have been reported in recent years (Guo et al., 2006; Wan et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2001; Deluzet et al., 2003).

One carboxylate group of the 5-aminoisophthalate dianion chelates a Co cation and the other carboxylate group bridges the other two Co cations, while the terminal N atoms of the 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane ligand coordinate the neighboring Co cations, forming a twodimensional polymeric architecture. Two pyridine rings of the 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane ligand are twisted to each other with a dihedral angle of 50.94 (16). Weak C—HO hydrogen bonding and N—H interactions are observed in the crystal structure.

In a small number of these, the dioxane bridges through its two O atoms between two Li centres (Evans et al., 1985), in some cases to give polymers (Taube et al., 1993; Andrews et al., 1995; Nrth et al., 1996), and there are two rather complex species in which there is both bridging and monodentate coordination (Cramer et al., 1986; Uhl et al., 1991).

In the subunit, two peripheral symmetry-related CuII cations have square-pyramidal CuNO4 geometry and the central third CuII cation lies on an inversion centre with octahedral CuN2O4 geometry. In (I), each partially deprotonated di-Schiff base 3-{[2-(3-hydroxy-2-oxidobenzylidene)hydrazinylidene]methyl}benzene-1,2-diolate ligand (Hbcaz3) acts as a heptadentate ligand to bind the CuII centres into chains along the a axis. A centrosymmetric Cu2O2 unit containing an asymmetrically bridging O atom, being axial at one Cu atom and equatorial at the other Cu atom, links the trinuclear CuII subunit into a one-dimensional chain, which is reinforced by intramolecular phenol–methanol O—HO and methanol–phenolate O—HO hydrogen bonds. Interchain - stacking interactions between pyrocatechol units, with a distance of 3.5251 (18) A˚ , contribute to the stability of the crystal packing.\\n\\nComment\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Comment\\n\\nSignificant interest in the coordination chemistry of polydentate Schiff bases arises not only from their ability to construct metal–organic molecular architectures using their N- and O-atom donors (Li et al., 2003; Winpenny, 1998; Dong et al., 2000), but also from their potential applications in enantioselective processes (Sreerama et al., 2007), as magnetic materials (Andruh 2011), using their DNA binding and cleavage activities (Kou et al., 2009), antimicrobial and antitumour activities (Poulter et al., 2011), and antiradical activity (Puterova et al., 2011), and as organic catalysts (Mukherjee et al., 2011). The design of these polydentate ligands remains an important element for assembling coordination polymers with fascinating topologies (Yang et al., 2009). Compared with the\\n\\nwidely used mono-Schiff bases (Jeewoth et al., 1999), di-Schiff bases have two or more phenol –OH groups at the terminal positions and one aliphatic imine group between the aromatic rings, and therefore can exhibit diverse coordination modes of the metal ions and a concomitant tendency to form homo- and heteropolynuclear coordination complexes. In addition, they have flexible skeletons, which can rotate freely around the C—N and N—N single bonds to meet the requirements of the coordination geometries of the metal ions in the assembly process.\\n\\nThe above considerations focused our attention on the'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The above considerations focused our attention on the\\n\\npolydentate di-Schiff base 3,30-[(1E,2E)-hydrazinediylidenebis(methanylylidene)]di(benzene-1,2-diol) (H4bcaz), which has been synthesized to assemble dinuclear triple-stranded helicates with TiIV and VIV cations in the presence of alkali metal carbonate (Albrecht et al., 2003; Siegers et al., 2004). However, metal complexes of this versatile di-Schiff base ligand are rare.

Remarkably, the H4bcaz ligand has four phenol –OH and two imine N-atom coordination sites, of which the four phenol –OH groups can be deprotonated, depending on the reaction conditions, so its coordination modes are difficult to control and predict when coordinating metal centres. Based on the above points and as part of our continuing investigations of coordination polymers (Sun et al., 2009; Dai et al., 2008), we have used H4bcaz to assemble a CuII one-dimensional coordination polymer, namely catena-poly[bis(4-3-{[2-(3-hydroxy-2-oxidobenzylidene)hydrazinylidene]methyl}benzene1,2-diolato)dimethanoltricopper(II)], (I), in which a triply deprotonated form of H4bcaz binds three CuII cations to form a rare trinuclear CuII subunit.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='As shown in Fig. 1, the asymmetric unit of (I) contains two crystallographically independent CuII centres, one of which lies on a site of 1 symmetry, one Hbcaz3- ligand and one coordinated methanol molecule. The central Cu1 atom is sixcoordinated in an octahedral environment, in which the four in-plane donors are two phenolate O atoms and two imine N atoms belonging to two inversion-related Hbcaz3- ligands, and the axial positions are occupied by O atoms from two methanol molecules. The outer CuII centres obviously have identical CuNO4 ligand environments, owing to inversion symmetry. This geometry of the outer CuII centres could be described as slightly distorted square-pyramidal comprising four phenolate O and one imine N atom. The apical position is occupied by a phenolate O atom from the Hbcaz3- ligand of a neighbouring subunit. The distortion of the CuNO4 square pyramid is indicated by the calculated value of the 5 parameter (Addison et al., 1984), which is 0.014 for atom Cu2 (for ideal square-pyramidal geometry, 5 = 0).\\n\\nThe CuCu separation between nearest neighbours within the trinuclear subunit is 3.3396 (3) A˚ , which is longer than that in a similar trinuclear CuII subunit with acetate bridging at the axial positions (Chiari et al., 1985). The equatorial Cu—O bond lengths in the CuII coordination environment range from 1.8795 (17) to 1.9459 (16) A˚ and the axial Cu—O bond lengths, with an average value of 2.498 (9) A˚ , are longer than those in the equatorial plane, indicating the Jahn–Teller effect for both CuII centres (Murphy & Hathaway, 2003). The Cu—N bond length has an average value of 1.99 (4) A˚ (Table 1). The ligand adopts a twisted conformation, with a C8—N2—N1— C7 torsion angle of 42.6 (3) around the N2—N1 bond.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='It is clear from the structure of (I) that each H4bcaz molecule is partially deprotonated to form the Hbcaz3- trianion, which acts as a heptadentate ligand (three phenolate O-atom donors and two imine N-atom donors) to chelate four CuII centres, three from one trinuclear subunit and the fourth from a neighboring subunit. A centrosymmetric Cu2O2 unit containing asymmetrically bridging O atom, O1, being axial at one Cu atom and equatorial at the other Cu atom, plays a crucial role in extending the trinuclear CuII subunits into a onedimensional chain along the a axis (Fig. 2). Notably, there is a CuCu separation of 3.0936 (5) A˚ in the Cu2O2 unit, which is much shorter than that within the trinuclear subunit. In addition, two types of intrachain O—HO hydrogen bonds are observed within the one-dimensional chain, viz. phenol– methanol O—HO and methanol–phenolate O—HO (first and second entries, respectively, in Table 2), and these also play an important role in stabilizing the one-dimensional chain. According to graph-set notation (Bernstein et al., 1995), the two types of intrachain O—HO hydrogen bond form a cyclic R22(9) motif. Interchain - stacking interactions between pyrocatechol units [Cg1Cg1v = 3.5251 (18) A˚ , where Cg1 is the centroid of the C9–C14 ring; symmetry code: (v) x, -y + 1, -z] contribute to the stability of the crystal packing.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The linear trinuclear CuII subunit of (I) is very different from that of the previously reported discrete complex [Cu3(H2L)(L)]2H2O, (II) [H4L is N,N0-bis(3-hydroxysalicylidene)butane-1,4-diamine; Sanmart et al., 1999], where the three CuII centres are held together by two phenolate bridges to form an isosceles triangle with a CuCu separation of 3.413 (3) A˚ , which is longer than the shortest CuCu separation in (I). The formation of different trinuclear CuII subunits could be attributed to the existence of the long –(CH2)4– spacer between two imine groups in H4L, which allows H4L to twist and so achieves in (II) an isosceles triangle arrangement of three CuII centres, instead of the linear arrangement found in (I).\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nH4bcaz was synthesized by a modification of the procedure of Albrecht et al.

Two CdII atoms are bridged by carboxylate groups of the pdc ligands to create a dimeric unit. The dimeric units are further connected by the pdc ligands to generate an interesting two-dimensional structure.\\n\\nComment\\n\\nThe ®eld of metal±organic coordination polymers has undergone signi®cant growth over the past decade, not only because of their intriguing structural diversity but also because of their tremendous potential applications as functional materials (Eddaoudi et al., 2001; Shi et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2005; Fang, Zhu, Jin et al., 2006). So far, most effort in this ®eld has been focused on using either neutral ligands (e.g. 4,40-bipyridine) or anionic ligands (e.g. carboxylates) (Tian et al., 2006). However, in recent years, multifunctional ligands bearing both neutral and anionic donor groups have attracted much attention\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='because of their interesting structural features (Ghosh & Bharadwaj, 2006). The presence of different functional groups may allow diversity in the mode of coordination and may result in the interesting properties for the coordination polymers. Based on this consideration, we prepared the title twodimensional coordination polymer, [Cd(pdc)]n, (I), composed of Cd2+ and pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate (pdc) with N- and O- donor atoms.\\n\\nSelected bond lengths and angles for (I) are given in Table 1.\\n\\nEach CdII centre is hexacoordinated, residing in a distorted octahedral environment surrounded by ®ve carboxylate O atoms and one N atom from ®ve distinct pdc ligands (Fig. 1).\\n\\nAtoms N1, O1, O1i and O3iii comprise the basal plane, while atoms O2ii and O4iv occupy the axial positions (see Table 1 for symmetry codes). The axial O2iiÐCd1ÐO4iv angle is 173.55 (7) in the resulting polyhedron, indicating a slight octahedral distortion (Table 1). The coordination environment of the CdII centre in (I) is similar to those observed in the related three-dimensional pillared±layer coordination polymers {[Cd- (pdc)(azpy)]2H2O}n and {[Cd(pdc)(bpee)]1.5H2O}n {azpy is 1,2-dipyridin-4-yldiazene and bpee is 4-[2-(pyridin-4-yl)- vinyl]pyridine} (Maji et al., 2004). The CdÐO distances range from 2.224 (2) to 2.486 (2) AÊ , which are near to the values found in our previously reported three-dimensional coordination polymer [Cd11(HCOO)6(bpdc)9]9DMF6H2O (bpdc is 4,40-biphenyldicarboxylate and DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide) (Fang, Zhu, Xue et al., 2006).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='An interesting aspect of the structure of (I) is that each pdc ligand bonds to ®ve CdII centres. The number of coordination sites of the pdc unit of (I) is much higher than in other metal± pdc complexes (Li et al., 2004; Tian et al., 2003; Kitaura et al., 2002). Notably, one pyrazine N atom coordinates to the CdII centre, while the remaining N atom does not associate with the CdII atom. This observation may be attributed to the steric hindrance of the pdc ligand, which reduces the coordination abilities of the N atoms.\\n\\nThe two CdII atoms are bridged by pdc ligands through their carboxylate groups to form a dimeric unit with a bond distance of 3.899 (4) AÊ . Such a CdCd distance bridged by carboxylate groups has also been observed in another CdII complex formed with carboxylate ligands (Zang et al., 2006). As a result, the dimers are further connected by pdc ligands to furnish an extended neutral two-dimensional layer.\\n\\nWithin this layer, each pyrazine ring is orientated in the same way and the dihedral angle between the pyrazine rings is Figure 1\\n\\nThe structure of (I), showing the atomic numbering scheme.

Such an arrangement of adjacent pyrazine rings has not been observed to date in metal complexes constructed by the pdc ligand (Li et al., 2004; Tian et al., 2003; Kitaura et al., 2002). The carboxylate bond lengths C6ÐO1 and C6ÐO4 are different, suggesting localization of bonding in the carboxylate groups. It should be pointed out that compound (I) has the same CdII±pdc ratio (1:1) as both {[Cd(pdc)(azpy)]2H2O}n and {[Cd(pdc)(bpee)]1.5H2O}n prepared by solution methods at room temperature (Maji et al., 2004), but without water content. This agrees with the fact that the hydrothermal reaction can create more condensed products with little or no water content (Zhu et al, 2006).

One MnII ion and the geometric centre of one 1,4-phenylenediacetate ligand in the trinuclear unit both lie on inversion centres. Trinuclear units are bridged by 1,4phenylenediacetate ligands to yield a two-dimensional network which stacks into a three-dimensional supramolecular structure via - stacking interactions.\\n\\nReceived 11 August 2006 Accepted 28 August 2006\\n\\nComment\\n\\nTo achieve the desired structure and properties of porous\\n\\nmetal-organic frameworks, rigid ligands are usually chosen as the linker molecules in preference to flexible ligands because they enable easier control of the shape and size of the resulting pores (Stepanow et al., 2004; Rosi et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2004). However, metal-organic frameworks assembled from flexible ligands may show some unusual advantages over those assembled from rigid ligands. Therefore, we report here the synthesis and crystal structure of the complex [Mn3(2,20bpy)2(PDA)3]n containing the flexible ligand 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid (H2PDA).\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Fig. 1 shows the trinuclear building block for compound (I), which has inversion centres located both on the centre of the benzene ring of one 1,4-phenylenediacetate ligand and on atom Mn1, such that there are two crystallographically unique MnII centres.

The other MnII centre (Mn1) is linked to six O atoms from six carboxylate groups in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry. The two MnII centres are bridged by three carboxylate groups to form a linear trinuclear building block, which is similar to a previously reported case (Chen et al., 2006). Adjacent trinuclear building blocks are connected by two 1,4-phenylenediacetate ligands to yield a one-dimensional chain along the b axis. Each trinuclear building block in the chain is further linked to another one in the neighbouring chain by another 1,4-phenylenediacetate ligand, resulting in the construction of a step-like two-dimensional coordination network parallel to the bc plane (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3, the corresponding pyridyl rings of 2,20-bipyridine from neighbouring two-dimensional sheets overlap with each other with a centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.892 (1) A˚ and a dihedral angle of 6.9 (1). This indicates the existence of – stacking effects between these pyridyl rings. These – stacking interactions connect the two-dimensional sheets into a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture.\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nTo a mixture of MnCl24H2O (0.0792 g, 0.4 mmol), 1,4-phenylenediacetic acid (0.0777 g, 0.4 mmol), NaOH (0.032 g, 0.8 mmol) and 2,20-bipyridine (0.0624 g, 0.4 mmol) placed in a 23 ml Teflon-lined autoclave were added 7 ml of distilled water and 3 ml of methanol.

The Mn atom is octahedrally coordinated by one carboxylate O atom and one hydroxyl O atom from both gluconate ligands and two water O atoms in cis positions. Mn--O distances range between 2.091 (5) and 2.275 (5) /~. The independent gluconate ions assume different bent-chain conformations and one is bonded to two adjacent Mn atoms forming polymeric chains parallel to b. There is extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding (and one intramolecular hydrogen bond) involving all the hydroxyl and water H atoms and holding the polymeric units together.\\n\\nIntroduction. Sawyer, Bodini, Willis, Riechel & Magers (1977) have suggested that the Mn complexes formed by the gluconate ion in basic media undergo oxidationreduction which may parallel the behaviour of the Mn group in photosystem-II of green-plant photosynthesis.\\n\\nThe structure of these complexes was investigated by UV-VIS spectrometry, polarography, ESR and magnetic-susceptibility measurements (Sawyer & Bodini, 1975; Bodini & Sawyer, 1976; Sawyer et al., 1977). The present paper presents the crystal structure of Mn(gluconate) 2. 2H20. Attempts to isolate the other gluconate complexes of higher oxidation states of Mn in crystalline form were unsuccessful.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Single crystals were grown at room temperature by slow evaporation of an aqueous solution of a commercial product obtained through ICN-K&K Labs. Weissenberg photographs showed that the crystal system is triclinic. An irregular crystal, 0.10 to 0.16 mm on edge, was selected for data collection. A Syntex P2~ diffractometer and Cu Ka radiation with a graphite monochromator were used for lattice-parameter and intensity measurements. The intensities were measured by the 20-09 scan technique. After each group of 30 reflexions two standards were measured; no significant change in intensity was observed. The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects but not for absorption or extinction.

All calculations were performed with the Syntex XTL structure determination system (Nova 1200 computer and additional external disc memory). Neutral-atom scattering factors were from International Tables for X-ray Crystallography (1974); both real and imaginary components of the anomalous dispersion were included for Mn and O.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Since the compound is optically active, the space group P1 was assumed, in which all atoms occupy general positions.

Twelve H atoms (bonded to C) were placed in geometrically calculated positions at 1.08 A from the bonded atoms. All remaining H atoms were found from subsequent difference syntheses. Further refinement with fixed parameters for H atoms reduced R to 0.033 and R w to 0.045. (The refinement of the inverted structure gave R = 0.132 and R w = 0.165.)

The difference in the conformations of the gluconate ions is probably due to differences in the metal-binding interactions. The overall conformation of gluconate ion B is similar to that of the gluconate ion in crystals of the monoclinic modification of potassium D-gluconate monohydrate (Panagiotopoulos, Jeffrey, La Placa & Hamilton, 1974). A straight-chain conformation for the gluconate ion was found in anhydrous potassium D-gluconate (Littleton, 1953) and in the orthorhombic form of potassium D-gluconate monohydrate (Panagiotopoulos et al., 1974).\\n\\nThe author thanks Miss D.

In order to further the study of H2TDA coordination modes, we report here the synthesis and crystal structure of the title CdII coordination polymer, [Cd(TDA)(Him)2(H2O)]n, (I). It was obtained by the hydrothermal reaction of cadmium dinitrate tetrahydrate, thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid and imidazole (Him) in an aqueous solution.\\n\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the asymmetric unit of (I) consists of\\n\\none CdII ion, one TDA2- dianion, two imidazole ligands and one coordinated water molecule. Each CdII atom is sevencoordinate and bound by four carboxylate O atoms from two independent TDA2- groups, two N atoms from two different imidazole ligands, and one water molecule. The local coordination of the CdII atom can be described as distorted pentagonal bipyramidal. The equatorial pentagonal plane is # 2006 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved\\n\\nFigure 2 The linear chain structure of the title complex.

The smallest O—Cd—O angle, 49.1 (3), is attributed to the bis-chelate coordination of the TDA2- ligand that forms two four-membered rings. It should be noted that the two C— O bond distances of the carboxylate group (O3/C6/O4) are almost equivalent, and so in agreement with its delocalized state, whereas the O2—C1 distance is longer than the O1—C1 distance, in accordance with the formal double-bond character of the O1—C1 bond. The dihedral angles between the two carboxylate groups and the thiophene ring are 5.3 (4) (O1/ C1/O2) and 6.0 (4) (O3/C6/O4), respectively, demonstrating that the TDA2- ligand is basically planar.\\n\\nEach TDA2- group binds in bis-bidentate chelating mode to link neighboring CdII atoms to form a one-dimensional linear chain structure which is propagated parallel to the b axis (Fig. 2), in which the closest CdCd distance is 10.577 (6) A˚ .\\n\\nFurthermore, the water and imidazole molecules form extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds with carboxylate O atoms (Table 2). There are –- stacking interactions between adjacent thiophene rings, the centroid–centroid separation being 3.694 (6) A˚ . The polymeric chains align in a manner that Cadmium dinitrate tetrahydrate (3.08 g, 10 mmol) was added to an aqueous solution of thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (1.72 g, 10 mmol). The pH was adjusted to 6 with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide. Imidazole (1.34 g, 20 mmol) was then added. The mixture was stirred for 1 h and then sealed in a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel bomb and held at 383 K for 3 d. The bomb was cooled naturally to room temperature, and colorless prismatic crystals of (I) were obtained.\\n\\nAnalysis calculated for C12H12N4O5SCd: C 33.00, H 2.77, N 12.83%; found: C 32.96, H 2.74, N 12.85%.\\n\\nCrystal Data'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Analysis calculated for C12H12N4O5SCd: C 33.00, H 2.77, N 12.83%; found: C 32.96, H 2.74, N 12.85%.\\n\\nCrystal Data\\n\\n[Cd(C6H2O4S)(C3H4N2)2(H2O)] Z = 2 Mr = 436.72 Dx = 1.838 Mg m3 Triclinic, P1 Mo K radiation a = 7.7486 (15) A˚ Cell parameters from 7316 b = 10.577 (2) A˚ reflections c = 10.947 (2) A˚ = 3.0–27.5 = 103.71 (3) = 1.55 mm1 = 101.57 (3) T = 295 (2) K = 108.43 (3) Prism, colorless V = 789.1 (4) A˚ 3 0.36  0.24  0.18 mm\\n\\nData Collection\\n\\n3564 independent reflections 2125 reflections with I > 2(I) Rint = 0.086 max = 27.5 h = 9 ! 10 k = 13 ! 13 l = 14 ! 11\\n\\nRigaku R-AXIS RAPID diffractometer ! scans Absorption correction: multi-scan (ABSCOR; Higashi, 1995) Tmin = 0.641, Tmax = 0.761 7628 measured reflections\\n\\nRefinement on F2 R[F2 > 2(F2 )] = 0.041 wR(F2 ) = 0.168 S = 1.06 3564 reflections 214 parameters\\n\\nRefinement Table 1\\n\\nCd1—O1w 2.341 (6) Cd1—N3 2.269 (7) Cd1—O1 2.829 (6) O1—C1 1.227 (14) Cd1—O2 2.318 (6) O2—C1 1.249 (14) Cd1—O3i 2.503 (6) O3—C6 1.244 (9) Cd1—O4i 2.413 (6) O4—C6 1.248 (10) Cd1—N1 2.267 (8) N3—Cd1—O1 80.4 (3) O2—Cd1—O1w 83.2 (2) O1w—Cd1—O1 86.1 (3) N1—Cd1—O4i 84.6 (3) O2—Cd1—O1 49.1 (3) N3—Cd1—O4i 103.5 (2) O1—Cd1—O3i 84.4 (3) O2—Cd1—O4i 165.8 (2) O1—Cd1—O4i 136.0 (2) O1w—Cd1—O4i 84.1 (2) O1—Cd1—N1 139.2 (2) N1—Cd1—O3i 136.3 (2) N1—Cd1—N3 96.3 (3) N3—Cd1—O3i 86.4 (2) N1—Cd1—O2 90.5 (3) O2—Cd1—O3i 133.2 (2) N3—Cd1—O2 90.2 (2) O1w—Cd1—O3i 89.3 (2) N1—Cd1—O1w 95.8 (2) O4i —Cd1—O3i 52.7 (2) N3—Cd1—O1w 166.2 (2)\\n\\nSelected geometric parameters (A˚ , ).\\n\\nSymmetry code: (i) x; y - 1; z.\\n\\nD—HA D—H HA DA D—HA O1w—H1w1O3ii 0.85 (7) 1.93 (4) 2.732 (8) 157 (8) O1w—H1w2O1iii 0.85 (6) 1.96 (3) 2.770 (10) 160 (7) N2—H14O4iv 0.86 1.92 2.758 (10) 165 N4—H15O2v 0.86 1.97 2.826 (10) 171\\n\\nH atoms treated by a mixture of independent and constrained refinement w = 1/[2 (Fo 2 ) + (0.0795P) 2 ] where P = (Fo  2 + 2Fc 2 )/3 (/)max < 0.001 max = 1.78 e A˚ 3 = 1.65 e A˚ 3  min\\n\\nTable 2\\n\\nHydrogen-bond geometry (A˚ , ).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Table 2\\n\\nHydrogen-bond geometry (A˚ , ).\\n\\nSymmetry codes: (ii) -x; y þ 1; z; (iii) x; -y; z; (iv) x; -y þ 1; z þ 1; (v) x þ 1; y; z.\\n\\nThe H atoms attached to C atoms and imidazole N atoms were placed in calculated positions, with C—H = 0.93 A˚ , N—H = 0.86 A˚ and Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C,N), and were refined with the riding-model approximation.

A Synchrotron Powder Diffraction Study\\n\\nReceived 18 February 2009 Accepted 18 June 2009 The crystal structures of strontium diformate in space groups P212121 (- form, 295 K), P41212 ( form, 334 and 540 K) and I41/amd ( form, 605 K), and strontium fumarate in space groups Fddd ( form, 105 K) and I41/amd (- form, 293 K) have been determined from synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data. Except for the -strontium diformate, all the structures are based on a diamond-like Sr-ion arrangement, as in strontium acetylene dicarboxylate. The formate ions are disordered in the phase owing to steric hindrance. The fumarate ions are disordered over four () or two () symmetry-equivalent orientations. -Strontium fumarate crystallizes with a unique 90- carboxylate dihedral angle, and is stable up to 773 K.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nRecent preclinical and clinical investigations have revealed that Sr2+ reduces bone re-sorption, while at the same time it provides a stimulus for new bone formation (Marie et al., 2001). This combined action on bone metabolism sets Sr2+ apart from existing osteoporosis therapies and has lead to a growing interest in Sr2+ salts with different organic anions.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Several organic strontium salts have recently been synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal methods (Christgau et al., 2005; Stahl, Andersen & Christgau, 2006; Stahl, Andersen & Nilsson, 2006; Christgau et al., 2006). However, some salts could not be produced as large enough crystals for single-crystal structure determination. One of those was strontium fumarate. From the first synthesis a powder diffraction database search-match identified the crystalline product as strontium diformate (Mentzen & Comel, 1974b). However, the strontium diformate searchmatch result referred to strontium diformate at 593 K in the space group I41/amd. At the same time a close similarity to the room-temperature powder diffraction pattern of strontium acetylene dicarboxylate (strontium ADC) was found, also in the space group I41/amd (Hohn et al., 2002). The three strontium salts were possibly isostructural. A Rietveld refinement of the strontium fumarate structure starting with the strontium and oxygen coordinates of strontium ADC (Hohn et al., 2002) rapidly converged and the missing carbon positions (one ordered and one disordered) were located in a difference-Fourier map. Furthermore, the synthesis of strontium diformate dihydrate and consecutive heating to 593 K produced a powder diffraction pattern very similar to that of strontium fumarate. A Rietveld refinement starting from the strontium fumarate structure confirmed the structural similarity. Therefore, all three structures are isostructural in terms of their strontium carboxyl parts.\\n\\n# 2009 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore - all rights reserved\\n\\nResearch Papers\\n\\nTable 1'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Powder diffraction data collection and refinement overview. -Sr(HCOO)2 at 293 K -Sr(HCOO)2 at 334 K -Sr(HCOO)2 at 540 K Crystal data Chemical formula C2H2O4Sr C2H2O4Sr C2H2O4Sr Mr 177.66 177.66 177.66 Crystal system, space group Orthorhombic, P212121 Tetragonal, P41212 Tetragonal, P41212 Temperature (K) 293 334 540 a, b, c (A˚ ) 6.86744 (3), 8.75087 (4), 7.26091 (3) 7.1358 (2), 7.1358 (2), 9.5908 (3) 7.09951 (7), 7.09951 (7), 10.0405 (1) V (A˚ 3 ) 436.35 (1) 488.36 (2) 506.07 (1) Z 4 4 4 Radiation type Synchrotron Synchrotron Synchrotron Radiation of incident radiation (A˚ ) 1.28406 (1) 1.28406 (1) 1.28406 (1) (mm1 ) 9.63 8.60 8.30 Specimen shape, size (mm) Cylinder, 2.0  0.3 Cylinder, 2.0  0.3 Cylinder, 2.0  0.3 Data collection Diffractometer Huber G670 Guinier camera Huber G670 Guinier camera Huber G670 Guinier camera Specimen mounting Quartz capillary Quartz capillary Quartz capillary Scan method Step Step Step Data-collection mode Transmission Transmission Transmission Absorption correction For a cylinder mounted on the ' axis For a cylinder mounted on the ' axis For a cylinder mounted on the ' axis Tmin 0.327 0.354 0.354 Tmax 0.368 0.397 0.397 2 () 2min = 12.005, 2max = 100.000, 2step = 2min = 12.001, 2max = 100.006, 2step = 2min = 12.006, 2max = 100.001, 2step = 0.005 0.005 0.005 Refinement Refinement on Inet Inet Inet Rp, Rwp, Rexp, RB, 2 0.028, 0.038, 0.007, 0.023, 29.48 0.032, 0.050, 0.004, 0.013, 167.96 0.024, 0.036, 0.005, 0.009, 47.05 Profile function Pseudo-Voigt Voigt Voigt No. of data points 17 600 17 600 17 600 No. of Bragg reflections 472 289 298 No. of parameters 55 38 39 (/)max 0.019 0.031 0.031 -Sr(HCOO)2  at 605 K -Sr(H2C4O4) at 105 K -Sr(H2C4O4) at 293 K Crystal data Chemical formula C2H2O4Sr C4H2O4Sr C4H2O4Sr Mr 177.66 201.68 201.68 Crystal system, space group Tetragonal, I41/amd Orthorhombic, Fddd Tetragonal, I41/amd Temperature (K) 605 105 293 a, b, c (A˚ ) 7.0904 (1), 7.0904 (1), 10.1697 (2) 10.5980 (1), 9.81628 (9), 10.00739 (8) 7.24689\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"space group Tetragonal, I41/amd Orthorhombic, Fddd Tetragonal, I41/amd Temperature (K) 605 105 293 a, b, c (A˚ ) 7.0904 (1), 7.0904 (1), 10.1697 (2) 10.5980 (1), 9.81628 (9), 10.00739 (8) 7.24689 (5), 7.24689 (5), 10.01133 (7) V (A˚ 3 ) 511.27 (1) 1041.10 (2) 525.77 (1) Z 4 8 4 Radiation type Synchrotron Synchrotron Synchrotron Wavelength of incident radiation (A˚ ) 1.28406 (1) 1.25176 (1) 1.25176 (1) (mm1 ) 8.21 7.58 7.51 Specimen shape, size Cylinder, 2.0  0.3 Cylinder, 2.0  0.3 Cylinder, 2.0  0.3 Data collection Diffractometer Huber G670 Guinier camera Huber G670 Guinier camera Huber G670 Guinier camera Specimen mounting Quartz capillary Quartz capillary Quartz capillary Scan method Step Step Step Data-collection mode Transmission Transmission Transmission Absorption correction For a cylinder mounted on the ' axis For a cylinder mounted on the ' axis For a cylinder mounted on the ' axis Tmin 0.354 0.423 0.423 Tmax 0.397 0.452 0.452 2 () 2min = 12.002, 2max = 99.997, 2step = 2min = 10.996, 2max = 99.996, 2step = 2min = 10.997, 2max = 99.992, 2step = 0.005 0.005 0.005 Refinement Refinement on Inet Inet Inet Rp, Rwp, Rexp, RB, 2 0.025, 0.041, 0.005, 0.020, 65.61 0.043, 0.059, 0.008, 0.034, 54.76 0.047, 0.064, 0.007, 0.035, 85.01 Profile function Voigt Pseudo-Voigt Pseudo-Voigt No. of data points 17 600 17 800 17 800 No. of Bragg reflections 137 147 147 No. of parameters 34 35 36 (/)max 0.043 0.045 0.024\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Computer programs used: Huber G670, WINPOW, local Rietveld program, EXPO (Altomare et al., 1994, 1995), ATOMS6.2 (Dowty, 2002).\\n\\nPowder diffractograms of strontium diformate, = 1.284065 (1) A˚ (top), and strontium fumarate, = 1.251760 (1) A˚ (bottom).

If the idealized site were occupied the distance between adjacent C atoms would be 3.674 (9) A˚ . Adding the H atoms with C—H distances of 1.05 A˚ would result in H—H distances of 1.574 A˚ , much shorter than twice their van der Waals radii. The C1 disordering thus allows for tolerable H—H distances (Fig. 5).\\n\\nWith cooling down to 502 K the phase transformed to yet another phase, -Sr(HCOO)2, where ordering of the formates reduces the space-group symmetry to P41212 (supplementary material). The phase is retained with further cooling to 334 K (Fig. 4b and supplementary material). On cooling to room temperature the phase is initially retained, but it transforms back to the - phase within a few minutes. We had wanted to follow this sequence of transformations in more detail. However, owing to radiation damage it was only possible to record two datasets per sample (maximum 10 min in the beam) before peak broadening and low intensity spoiled the powder patterns and data interpretation.\\n\\n3.2.

On heating to 673 K the strontium fumarate structure showed continuous increases in both the a and c axes, but without signs of any phase transitions. Neither did the TGA/DSC measurements indicate any phase transitions until the final breakdown starting at approximately 773 K (Fig. 2). However, on cooling to 105 K strontium fumarate transformed to an orthorhombic phase in the space group Fddd. On slow heating it transforms back to tetragonal between 250 and 270 K. On repeated cooling the transformation appeared gradually with a coexistence of the two phases between 293 and 200 K (Fig. 6).

Strontium Diformate\\n\\nIn -strontium diformate the ordered H sites are too close in the c direction, which force a displacement of the C and H sites in the a and b directions.

Strontium Fumarate'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='a large increase in density, 11.9%, which can be considered as the driving force for this phase transformation.\\n\\n4.2. Strontium Fumarate\\n\\nIn -strontium fumarate, the fumarate shows an unusual carboxylate dihedral angle of 90- despite an energy loss of 13 kJ mol1 relative to a planar conformation (Fig. 3). This is in contrast to the ADC conformation in strontium ADC (Hohn et al., 2002), where the 90- dihedral angle corresponds to the energy minimum (Fig. 3). In fact, a 90- carboxylate dihedral angle is unique for fumarate and fumaric acid derivatives: A search of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD; Allen, 2002) resulted in 322 structures containing fumarates, fumaric acid or derivatives thereof; only four have a dihedral angle of 90, and they all have either altered conjugation schemes by substitutions and/or coordination. Among pure fumarates, hydrogen fumarates or fumaric acids only very few showed deviations from planar conformation and then by a maximum of 30. On the other hand, the strained conformation in strontium fumarate explains the existence of the lowtemperature -phase simply as an attempt to reduce the conformational strain. The dihedral angle at 105 K is 76, increasing to 77- at 250 K, corresponds to an energy gain of 2 kJ mol1.\\n\\nThe a/b ratio at 105 K of 1.08 is most likely the reason for the sluggish - to transformation on cooling. This large difference will create strain in the material during the phase transformation, which will hamper the completion of the transformation (cf. for instance, the martensitic transformation in carbon steel).\\n\\n5. Conclusions'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='5. Conclusions\\n\\nThe similarities in the powder diffraction patterns of strontium ADC, strontium fumarate and the high-temperature phase of strontium diformate is explained by the their very similar structures based on a diamond-like Sr-ion arrangement (Hohn et al., 2002). A variable-temperature powder diffraction study has clarified the phases present in the strontium diformate and fumarate systems: (i) Strontium diformate shows two stable phases: The - phase (P212121) stable up to 508 K; and the phase (I41/amd) stable from 508 to 633 K, where SrCO3 formation starts (Mentzen & Comel, 1974a). On cooling the phase a metastable phase (P41212) is formed, which can be maintained until room temperature. The phase is disordered in the formate C—H part for steric reasons, while the phase is fully ordered. There is no true cubic phase.\\n\\n(ii) Strontium fumarate shows two stable phases: The - phase (I41/amd) is stable between 260 and 800 K; the phase (Fddd) is stable below 260 K. The fumarate ions crystallize in the - phase with the most unfavorable carboxylate dihedral angle of 90, which is slightly reduced, to 76, in the phase at 105 K. The 90- dihedral angle is unique among known fumarate structures. The fumarate ions are disordered over four equivalent orientations in the - phase, and over two orientations in the phase. -Sr fumarate is stable to approximately 773 K.\\n\\nMs Hongling Mo Sønnichsen is acknowledged for the TGA/ DSC measurements and DANSYNC for financial support.')]\n",

The reasons for this increasing interest are the fundamental role of helicity in biology, potential applications in the fields of supramolecular chemistry, asymmetric catalysis, and nonlinear optical materials, and the aesthetically appealing topology of helical compounds. Univalent group 1B metal ions have a preference for a linear two-coordinate or a T-shaped threecoordinate geometry and can form one-dimensional helical compounds with bridging ligands (Carlucci et al., 1997; Erxleben, 2001; Jung et al., 2001, 2000; Oshio et al., 1999; Sailaja & Rajasekharan, 2003). Fluconazole, 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1,3-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propan-2-ol, can act as a bridging ligand through the two rigid 1,2,4-triazole groups. Several complexes of divalent metals with fluconazole have been structurally characterized (Gong et al., 2006; Han, Song et al., 2006; Han, Zhang et al., 2006). However, no univalent metal complex has been reported to date.

The CuI atom is coordinated by two N atoms from two fluconazole ligands and by one Cl ligand to furnish a trigonal planar geometry (Fig. 1). Each fluconazole ligand links two CuI centres via its two triazole ligands, leaving the hydroxyl group uncoordinated. The dihedral angle between the two triazole planes of fluconazole is 72.69 (9), and fluconazole can be considered as an angular bridging ligand in (I). The CuI centres are linked by fluconazole with a CuCu separation of 9.297 (17) A˚ (Fig. 2). Due to the angular bridging ligand and nonlinear N—Cu—N bond angle [116.13 (9)], compound (I) exhibits a one-dimensional helical structure with a pitch of 7.5683 (18) A˚ (Fig. 2).\\n\\nThe Cl ligand forms a hydrogen bond with the uncoordinated hydroxyl group of a fluconazole ligand in a neighbouring helix (Fig. 2) [O1—H1 = 0.82 A˚ , H1Cl1i = 2.39 A˚ , O1Cl1i = 3.146 (19) A˚ and O1—H1Cl1i = 153; symmetry code: (i) x, y, -z + 2]. Thus, alternate left- and right-handed helices are connected by these intermolecular O—HCl hydrogen bonds and a two-dimensional layer is constructed (Fig. 2). The title compound exhibits a threedimensional supramolecular structure constructed by strong interlayer –- stacking interactions (Fig. 2) [perpendicular distance 3.39 (3) A˚ , centroidcentroid distance 3.99 A˚ , for benzene rings with symmetry codes (x, y, z) and (1 - x, y, 2 - z)].\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nA mixture of CuCl (0.5 mmol, 0.050 g), aqueous H2SO4 (37.5%, 0.131 g), fluconazole (0.5 mmol, 0.153 g) and water (10 ml) was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 383 K for 3 d, followed by slow cooling to room temperature.

Benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate is a rigid rod-like spacer, well known in the construction of metalorganic polymers, and it has shown numerous interesting supramolecular architectures (Batten & Robson, 1998). However, similar ligands such as naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxylate (H2L2) have not been so well explored to date (Wang et al., 2006). In this work, the combination of H2L with CdII cations in DMA solvent (DMA = N,N-dimethylacetamide) resulted in the title compound, [Cd(L)(DMA)]n, (I), an interesting three-dimensional coordination polymer incorporating a covalently bound non-aqueous solvent molecule.\\n\\nSelected bond lengths and angles for (I) are given in Table 1.\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Selected bond lengths and angles for (I) are given in Table 1.\\n\\nIn complex (I), each CdII atom is six-coordinated by six O atoms from four L ligands (three monodentate, one bidentate) and one DMA molecule in a very distorted octahedral, or possibly irregular, coordination. The Cd—Oc (c = carboxylate) distances, which range from 2.217 (3) to 2.451 (3) A˚ (Table 1), are comparable to those observed for {[Cd(3-PYD)2(H2O)]- # 2006 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved\\n\\n2H2O}n [3-PYD = 3-(3-pyridyl)acrylate] (Li et al., 2005). The C—O distances in the C1/O1/O2 and C10/O4/O5 carboxylate groups suggest delocalized bonding for both groups. In the crystal structure, each L ligand bridges five CdII atoms, generating a distinctive three-dimensional structure (Fig. 2).\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nH2L (108 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added slowly to an N,N-dimethylacetamide solution (15 ml) of CdCl22.5H2O (114 mg, 0.5 mmol) with stirring at 363 K.

The ZnII center has a distorted tetrahedral geometry and the central atom of the bpp ligand is located at a special site with a C2 axis passing through it. A layer is formed by Zn±glu bonding. Such layers are pillared by bpp ligands, forming a three-dimensional framework with large channels. The inverted interpenetration of two three-dimensional frameworks completes the molecular structure.\\n\\nComment\\n\\nThe use of versatile multidentate ligands to design metalorganic coordination polymers has mushroomed recently, not only because such ligands can form intriguing structural topologies (Yaghi et al., 1998; Hagrman et al., 1999), but also\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='al., 2003), polyrotaxanes (Poleschak et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004), double helices (Piguet et al., 1997) and other uncommon species (Carlucci, Ciani & Proserpio, 2004; Carlucci, Ciani, Proserpio & Spadacini, 2004). The 1,3-di-4pyridylpropane (bpp) ligand, as an analogue of 4,40-bipyridine, possesses variable ¯exibility and functionality owing to the introduction of three methylene groups between the two pyridyl rings (Mukherjee et al., 2003; Wen et al., 2005). The saturated aliphatic dicarboxylate ligands, which exhibit conformational and coordination versatility due to the presence of single-bonded carbon chains, are also an attractive choice and are viewed as important ¯exible spacer ligands. As an elementary member of the ,!-dicarboxylate family, the glutarate anion has proven to be a versatile polydentate ligand (Zheng et al., 2004). However, metal coordination polymers based on mixed bpp and glutarate (glu) ligands, to our knowledge, have not been reported to date.

The two carboxylate groups of the glu ligand have different coordination modes; one bridges two Zn atoms in a bidentate syn±syn fashion, the shortest ZnZn distance being 3.569 (1) AÊ , while the other carboxylate group coordinates to the Zn atom in a monodentate fashion. The shortest ZnZn distance between Zn atoms separated by a glu ligand is 8.786 (1) AÊ . The angle between the planes of the two carboxylate groups is 77.02. The twist in the glu ligand occurs at atom C3; the C1ÐC2ÐC3ÐC4 torsion angle is 71.2 (6).\\n\\nThe bpp ligand acts as a 2-bridge and links two symmetryrelated Zn centers, with a ZnZn separation of 13.567 (2) AÊ .\\n\\nAtom C12 is located on a special site with a C2 axis passing through it. The twist in the bpp ligand also occurs at atom C12; the C8ÐC11ÐC12ÐC11(ÿx, y, 12 ÿ z) torsion angle is 174.5 (6) AÊ . The angle between the two pyridyl planes of the bpp ligand is 60.7.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the Zn atoms are interlinked by the glu ligands to generate a layer parallel to (111). The resulting layer is composed of 8- and 36-membered rings.

Such a layer can also be looked at as the vertical assembly of two groups of parallel chains with the dimetal units functioning as hinges. As shown in Fig. 3, the resulting layers are pillared by the ¯exible bpp ligands to form a threedimensional open framework, which contains large channels along the b axis of dimensions 17.135 (2) - 8.786 (2) AÊ . Large channels can also be found along the a or c axes. Owing to the orderly connection of the asymmetrical layers, there is no inversion center in a single open framework. However, the void spaces in the single framework are so large that two three-dimensional frameworks can interpenetrate each other, so as to complete the ®nal three-dimensional architecture (Fig. 4). An inversion center exists between the two independent frameworks owing to their inverted interpenetration.\\n\\nIn summary, we have successfully synthesized and structurally characterized a novel Zn polymer based on mixed ¯exible glu and bpp ligands.

The asymmetric unit contains half a ZnII cation, half an ADB ligand and half a water molecule. Each ZnII centre lies on a crystallographic twofold rotation axis and is five-coordinated by four O atoms of bridging carboxylate groups from four ADB ligands and one O atom from a water molecule, forming a distorted trigonal–bipyramidal coordination geometry. The [Zn(H2O)] subunits are bridged by carboxylate groups to give onedimensional [Zn(--COO)4(H2O)]n chains. The chains are linked by ADB ligands into two-dimensional sheets, and these sheets are further connected to neighbouring sheets via hydrogen bonds (OW—HW-O), forming a three-dimensional hydrogen-bond-stabilized structure with an unprecedented 374175262 topology.\\n\\nComment\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Comment\\n\\nIn recent years, azobenzoic acid derivatives such as azobenzenedicarboxylic, azobenzenetricarboxylic and azobenzenetetracarboxylic acids have been employed as bridging ligands for constructing various types of functional metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) (Cairns et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Bhattacharya et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Liu, Ren et al., 2011; Liu, Wan et al., 2011; Liu & Xu, 2009). For example, Yaghi and co-workers used 4,40-azodibenzoic acid (4,40- H2ADB) reacted with Tb(NO3)35H2O to form an interpenetrating network of {Tb2(ADB)3[(CH3)2SO]416[(CH3)2- SO]}n with a large free volume (Reineke et al., 2000). Recently, Lu and co-workers reported three porous MOFs constructed from azobenzene-3,5,40-tricarboxylic acid (H3ABTC) and Cd(NO3)24H2O or MnCl24H2O (Meng et al., 2011). Qiu and co-workers used 3,30,5,50-azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid (H4ABTC) to construct three three-dimensional microporous MOFs with NbO and PtS topologies, which show hydrogen storage and luminescent properties (Xue et al., 2008). As for 3,30-(diazenediyl)dibenzoic acid (H2ADB), Cudic et al. (1999) studied the host–guest chemistry between cyclo-bis-intercaland and ADB, and recently Chen et al. (2008) reported\\n\\nseven coordination polymers based on the assembly of H2ADB with Zn(OAc)2, PbI2, Co(OAc)2, Y(OAc)3, Sm(OAc)3 or Er- (OAc)3, and/or 1,10-phenanthroline, which displayed considerable structural variety. Chen's ZnII ADB coordination polymer, [Zn(ADB)(EtOH)]n, was synthesized from Zn(OAc)2, pyridine and H2ADB in a mixture of solvents (DMF/H2O/ EtOH) and shows a two-dimensional (4,4) network with Zn2 units serving as four-connecting square nodes (Chen et al., 2008). To better understand the coordination chemistry of 3,30- (diazenediyl)dibenzoic acid, we have employed it in a reaction with Zn(OAc)22H2O in H2O and obtained the title threedimensional supramolecular complex [Zn(ADB)(H2O)]n, (I).\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Polymer (I) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2/c and its asymmetric unit contains half a [Zn(ADB)(H2O)] unit, which sits across a twofold axis. As shown in Fig. 1, each ZnII cation adopts a distorted trigonal–bipyramidal coordination geometry, coordinated by four O atoms of bridging carboxylate groups from four ADB ligands (O1, O1ii, O2iii and O2iv, with the latter two atoms occupying the axial positions; see Fig. 1 for symmetry codes) and one O atom from a water molecule (O1W). The Zn—O bond lengths range from 1.9503 (19) to 2.184 (2) A˚ . The mean Zn—O bond length in (I) [2.047 (2) A˚ ] is longer than that of the corresponding bond in [Zn(azobenzene-4,40-dicarboxylate)(H2O)]n [2.069 (8) A˚ ; Fu et al., 2009], and the N N bond length [1.245 (5) A˚ ] is slightly longer than that observed in [Zn(ADB)(EtOH)]n [1.209 (4) A˚ ; Chen et al., 2008]. The O1—Zn1—O1ii and O2iii—Zn1—O2iv angles are 139.82 (13) and 174.46 (11), respectively, and the other O—Zn—O angles are in the range 87.23 (5)–110.09 (7), consistent with the distorted trigonal– bipyramidal configuration.

Topologically (Wells, 1997), if the ZnII centres are considered as nodes and the ADB ligands and hydrogen bonds are considered as linkers, the structure of (I) can be specified by a new Schla¨fli symbol of 374175262 (Fig. 5).\\n\\nAn interesting related structure was reported by Fu et al.\\n\\n(2009) based on 4,40-(diazenediyl)dibenzoic acid instead of the 3,30-(diazenediyl)dibenzoic acid used in this study.

Each AgI atom exhibits a distorted tetrahedral geometry de®ned by three O atoms of independent sulfonate groups and one C C bond of the naphthalene group.\\n\\nComment\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Comment\\n\\nThe study of the solid-state coordination and structural chemistry of organosulfonates has received growing attention over the past few years. Organosulfonate ions have proved able to generate not only highly robust and fascinating architectures but also `softer' networks with sponge-like properties by connecting main group metals (Cai et al., 2001) and some transition metal ions, such as barium(II) or silver(I), as reviewed by CoÃteÂ & Shimizu (2003). Cai (2004, and references therein) recently reviewed the coordinating preferences of some aromatic mono- and disulfonates with main group metals and some transition metals, and also the structural and functional properties of cadmium sulfonates. Organodisulfonates exhibit a greater potential to form a higherdimensional and more stable structure than do monosulfonates. However, there is little structural information about arenedisulfonate complexes involving the silver(I) ion, which often adopts distorted coordination geometries owing to the inherent lack of ligand ®eld stabilization effects. Along with their soft Lewis acidic properties, Ag+ ions may be a particularly good match for the ¯exible coordinative tendencies of sulfonate anions, leading to networks that may be readily capable of rearrangement.\\n\\nWe have obtained a novel complex, [Ag2(1,5-nds2ÿ)]n (1,5-nds is 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid), (I), by the reaction of AgNO3 with 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid in ethanol. A search of the Cambridge Structural Database (Allen, 2002) reveals one other silver complex with the same ligand, namely {[Ag(1,5-nds2ÿ)(MeCN)2]H3O+2H2O}n, in which the silver(I)\\n\\nion adopts a tetrahedral geometry and the 1,5-nds2ÿ ligand displays a 2,2-coordination mode (each sulfonate group is monodentate), bridging the silver(I) ions to form a chain structure (Shimizu et al., 1999).\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='In (I), however, the 1,5-nds2ÿ ligand adopts a 10,8-coordination mode, leading to a three-dimensional framework through both Ag±sulfonate and Ag±2-arene interactions. To the best of our knowledge, (I) is the ®rst metal complex involving the 10,8-1,5-nds2ÿ ligand.\\n\\nThe local coordination around the AgI atom, together with the atom-numbering scheme of (I), is shown in Fig. 1. The asymmetric unit contains one AgI atom and one-half of a 1,5naphthalenedisulfonate anion (1,5-nds2ÿ), the coordination being completed by inversion symmetry. The AgI atom is coordinated by three O atoms of independent sulfonate groups, with AgÐO bond lengths ranging from 2.377 (3) to 2.396 (3) AÊ [mean 2.385 (3) AÊ ; Table 1]; these are shorter than the AgÐO bond lengths [2.380 (2)±2.439 (2) AÊ ] in the onedimensional silver complex with 1,5-nds2ÿ (see above), suggesting a stronger AgÐOsulfonate interaction. In addition, the AgI atom in (I) also interacts with a naphthalene group through a C C bond, with AgÐC distances of 2.478 (4) and 2.645 (4) AÊ , within the range reported for silver(I)±aromatic complexes (2.36±2.77 AÊ ; Munakata et al., 1997, 1998, 1999).\\n\\nThe next closest contact between AgI and C atoms is 3.148 (3) AÊ . Therefore, the AgI atom exhibits a distorted tetrahedral geometry (regarding the C C group as one donor).

However, the naphthalene ring system has a standard pattern of bond lengths, whereby the shortest are always those labelled in the current structure as C1 C2 and C4 C5 (Allen et al., 1997). Thus, coordination by the silver ion does not seem to have changed this pattern signi®cantly. The silver ion may coordinate preferentially to this bond because it is shorter and more electron rich.\\n\\nThe dihedral angle between the plane of the naphthalene ring system and the plane de®ned by the three O atoms of the SO3 ÿ group is 83.6 (3). As shown in Fig. 2, the six O atoms of two SO3 ÿ groups are coordinated to the AgI ions, and the two SO3 ÿ groups function as a 6-bridge and construct a layer structure parallel to (011), with alternating organic±inorganic components. The inorganic portion consists of eightmembered rings [represented as (AgÐOÐSÐO)2], which exhibit `chair-like' pro®les. The eight-membered rings propagate parallel to the a axis by sharing one edge (AgÐOÐS) with neighboring rings, forming Ag1Ag1A, Ag1Ag1B, Ag1AAg1B and Ag1BAg1F distances of 5.208 (3), 4.507 (3), 4.406 (3) and 13.310 (3) AÊ , respectively [symmetry codes: (A) x + 1, y, z; (B) 1 ÿ x, ÿy, 1 ÿ z; (F) x, y + 1, z ÿ 1].\\n\\nThe naphthalene ring moiety of the 1,5-nds2ÿ group shows a\\n\\nA perspective view of the organic±inorganic layer of (I).

The key step in the design of coordination polymers is to select suitable multidentate bridging ligands and spacers. Accordingly, benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid (H4TCB) has a very versatile coordination behaviour, since it can form bridges between metallic centres, generating varied and sometimes surprising molecular architectures. Therefore, numerous complexes with the H4TCB ligand have been extensively studied (Cheng et al., 2001; Chu et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2000), although the construction of complexes from H4TCB, 1,10phenanthroline (phen) and CuII building blocks is still limited (Shi et al., 2001; Zou et al., 1998). To the best of our knowledge, only a one-dimensional double-chain polymer, [Cu2(TCB)- (phen)2]nnH2O, has been reported to date (Shi et al., 2001).\\n\\nWe report here the hydrothermal synthesis and structure of the title one-dimensional zigzag chain polymer, [Cu(phen)- (H2TCB)]n, (I). It is entirely possible to prepare [Cu2-\\n\\n(TCB)(phen)2] and [Cu(phen)(H2TCB)] separately. The compositions of the complexes can be controlled by using different molar ratios of the reactants and different H-atom receptors, such as phen alone, phen and NaOH, etc.\\n\\nIn (I), the CuII cation is coordinated by two N atoms from\\n\\none phen ligand and two O atoms from two H2TCB2ÿ anions (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

The Mn atoms and coordinated water molecule are located on a twofold axis, and the bridging adipate ligand is located on an inversion center. The adipate dianions bridge neighboring MnII atoms to form polymeric chains. Each MnII atom is seven-coordinate, the longest MnÐO bond length being 2.5356 (16) AÊ .\\n\\nComment\\n\\nWater oxidation in the photosynthetic process of green plants (Bruckner et al., 1993) is generally believed to occur at a manganese cluster located in the reaction center of photosystem II (Vincent & Christou, 1989). In order to mimic the manganese cluster, a series of manganese complexes bridged by carboxylate ligands have been synthesized in our laboratory, among which some crystal structures revealed the existence of signi®cant electrostatic interaction between the Mn atom and the ligand (Nie et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2002; Liu & Xu, 2003). In the title MnII complex, (I), the seven-coordinate geometry clearly suggests electrostatic interaction between the MnII atom and the coordinated O atoms.\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='coordinated water molecule are located on a crystallographic twofold axis. The two benzimidazole molecules coordinate to the Mn atom in a trans mode. The MnÐN3 bond (Table 1) is longer than the MnÐN bonds in the imidazole complex of MnII [2.183 (3) and 2.190 (3) AÊ ; Liu et al., 2003]. The longer MnÐN3 bond is a result of the poor overlap of atomic orbitals between atoms Mn and N3, as veri®ed by the large angle [19.53 (7)] between the MnÐN3 bond and the mean plane of the BZIM group containing atom N1, and the appreciable deviation [0.762 (3) AÊ ] of the Mn atom from the BZIM mean plane. Two carboxy O2 atoms and two BZIM N3 atoms form the equatorial coordination plane. The Mn atom lies almost in the equatorial plane, with a small displacement [0.0344 (12) AÊ ] towards atom O1. This implies that the coordination geometry in the complex is not square pyramidal, and some bonding interaction occurs in the direction opposite to the MnÐO1 bond, as discussed below.\\n\\nTwo adipate dianions symmetrically coordinate to the Mn atom in a weak chelating mode (see Fig. 1). While the MnÐO2 distance and O2ÐMnÐO2ii angle [symmetry code: (ii) ÿx 1, y; ÿz 12] imply a normal MnÐO2 coordinate bond, the longer distance of 2.5356 (16) AÊ suggests that the MnÐO3 bond is semi-coordinate, balancing the bonding interaction between atoms Mn and O1 and resulting in the Mn atom being located almost in the equatorial plane, as mentioned above.\\n\\nFurther evidence supporting the MnÐO3 bonding interaction is provided by the small MnÐO2ÐC11 bond angle.

The Mn atom and the Figure 2 A stereoview of the molecular packing, showing polymeric chains.\\n\\nDashed lines indicate hydrogen bonding between neighboring chains.\\n\\ncarboxylate groups have been reported, and the geometric parameters of their carboxyl groups are compared in Table 3. Two kinds of MnÐO2ÐC bond angles are observed in these structures, viz. either less than 100 or larger than 120. Corresponding to these different MnÐO2ÐC angles, two kinds of MnÐO3 distances are observed in the structures. The smaller MnÐO2ÐC angle corresponds to a shorter MnÐO3 distance (shorter than 2.6 AÊ ) and suggests a bonding interaction between atoms Mn and O3, i.e. the carboxyl group is chelating. The larger MnÐO2ÐC angle corresponds to a longer MnÐO3 distance (longer than 3.3 AÊ ) and suggests a monodentate carboxyl group.\\n\\nIn the title MnII complex, both the MnÐO2ÐC11 bond angle and the MnÐO3 distance (Table 1) are close to those found in the chelate complexes but signi®cantly different from those found in the monodentate complexes. These facts clearly indicate that the carboxyl group of adipate in the MnII complex acts as a chelating rather than a monodentate ligand.\\n\\nThus, the MnII atom assumes a seven-coordinate geometry with a double-capped pyramidal con®guration (Fig. 1).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Thus, the MnII atom assumes a seven-coordinate geometry with a double-capped pyramidal con®guration (Fig. 1).\\n\\nThe adipate dianion is located on an inversion center and has an extended, nearly coplanar, carbon skeleton, the C11Ð C12ÐC13ÐC13i torsion angle being 173.5 (2) [symmetry code: (i) ÿx 12 ; ÿy 32 ; ÿz 1]. This is different from the situation found in most adipate complexes. In the complexes reported previously, the ¯exible carbon skeleton of the adipate ion usually displays a curled conformation (Pajunen & Nasakkala, 1977; McCann et al., 1997; Suresh et al., 1997; Darensbourg et al., 1996; Tosik et al., 1995). For example, the adipate±CuII complex aquabis(benzimidazole)copper(II)-- adipate (Suresh & Bhadbhade, 1997) has the same chemical component (except for the central ion) and the same coordination mode for the adipate ion as the title MnII complex. However, in the CuII complex, the adipate ion displayed the curled conformation, resulting in cell dimensions that differ from those of the title MnII complex.\\n\\nIn (I), adipate dianions bridge neighboring MnII atoms through both terminal carboxyl groups to form polymeric complex chains, as shown in Fig. 2. Neighboring polymeric chains are linked to one another via OÐHO and NÐ HO hydrogen bonds (Table 2) to form a three-dimensional network.\\n\\nAromatic ± stacking has commonly been observed in crystal structures including BZIM.

The TbIII ion, the inic anion and the water molecules occupy general positions. One of the two crystallographically independent oxalate anions is located on a center of inversion, whereas the second is located on the twofold rotation axis. The carboxylate groups of the inic and oxalate anions link the terbium metal centres into layers.

Introduction'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Keywords: crystal structure; three-dimensional coordination polymers; lanthanide structures; lanthanide sulfates.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nLanthanide chemistry has been a thriving area of research due to the unique properties of lanthanide ions, such as high coordination numbers, subtle differences in reactivity seen along the series, luminescence and magnetism (Bu¨nzil, 2006; Bu¨nzil & Piguet, 2005; Cahill et al., 2007; Sorace et al., 2011). The structural variety seen among lanthanide coordination compounds depends on the ligands and the synthetic method employed. The use of ligands with multiple binding sites may give rise to clusters as well as to coordination polymers. Due to their high coordination numbers and their marked preference for hard donors, carboxylic acids serve as good building blocks in the construction of multi-dimensional lanthanide coordination polymers. By introducing other ligands into the synthesis, the dimensionality and properties of such compounds can be varied. Previously, there have been many\\n\\nreports of polymeric lanthanide (Ln) complexes with oda2 (odaH2 is oxydiacetic acid), including heterometallic coordination polymers (Baggio et al., 1998; Kremer et al., 2008; Mao et al., 1997; Rizzi et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2007). Our previous work with the Ln–Mn–oda2 system resulted in a cubic architecture reminiscent of Prussian blue (Prasad et al., 2007). In order to study the effect of strongly coordinating SO4 2 dianions (towards lanthanides) on the polymeric structures, hydrothermal reactions were performed with Ln2O3 [Ln = Pr for (I), Nd for (II) and Sm for (III)], ZnSO4 and odaH2. The crystals formed have the following formulae: [Pr2(oda)- (SO4)2(H2O)2]0.5H2O for (I), and [Ln2(oda)2(SO4)(H2O)2]- 1.32H2O [Ln = Nd for (II) and Sm for (III)]. In these compounds, the SO4 2 dianion acts as a versatile bridging ligand along with oda2 to form three-dimensional networks.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The SO4 2 dianions have entirely different coordination modes in (I) and (II)/(III) and one of the bridging modes has only rarely been observed to date.\\n\\n2.

The positions of the water H atoms were determined from difference Fourier maps and refined using a riding model, with Uiso(H) = 1.5Ueq(O). The large displacement parameters of some of the solvent water molecules indicated fractional site-occupation factors which were therefore refined. Accordingly, the site occupancy of the solvent water molecule in (I) is 0.5, and the disordered water molecule on the inversion centre in (II) and (III) has a site occupancy of 0.32. It should be noted that in (I), 13 out of 3119, in (II), 11 out of 4230, and in (III), 14 out of 4177 reflections with Fo 2 << Fc 2 have been omitted from the final refinement.\\n\\n3.

Geometric details and symmetry codes are given in Table 2. The two Pr3+ cations have different coordination environments. Atom Pr1 is ten-coordinated and is in a highly distorted bicapped square antiprismatic geometry, while Pr2 is nine-coordinated with a distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry. As shown in Fig. 1, the Pr1 coordination consists of five O atoms from two symmetry-related oda2 ligands (O1, O1iii, O2iii, O3 and O4), four O atoms from SO4 2 dianions (O6, O7, O8i and O14ii) water molecule (O10). The Pr2 coordination consists of three O atoms from two symmetryrelated oda2 ligands (O4, O5 and O5vi), five O atoms from two SO4 2 dianions (O9iv, O11, O11ii, O12 and O13v) and one coordinated water molecule (O15).

In the present compounds, there are three different types of SO4 2 dianion coordination, as shown in Fig. 6. In (I), the two SO4 2 dianions are coordinated to Pr3+ in different ways, one in mode A and the other in mode B, while in (II) and (III) the SO4 2 dianions are coordinated in mode C. A search of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD, Version 5.34; Allen, 2002) was performed to check how common these modes are 2 3, which is the basic is the role of ZnSO4, which acts as the source of SO4 2 dianions. Reactions using other SO4 2 salts did not yield any of the present compounds, indicating the importance of ZnSO4 in the synthesis. Compound (I) has a higher SO4 2 content and an entirely different structure compared with (II) and (III), which are isomorphous. This is in contrast with the other Ln–oda complexes reported, which are usually isostructural for almost the entire lanthanide series, further indicating the pivotal role played by SO4 2 dianions in the present structures. The SO4 2 dianion in these compounds tends to reach saturation as a donor, binding to four or five metal atoms at the same time, leading to very rarely observed coordination modes.\\n\\nThe X-ray data were collected at the diffractometer facility at the University of Hyderabad, established by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.

All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s. planes.\\n\\nRefinement. Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F2, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F2. The threshold expression of F2 > σ(F2) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R-factors based on ALL data will be even larger.\\n\\nFractional atomic coordinates and isotropic or equivalent isotropic displacement parameters (Å2)\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Fractional atomic coordinates and isotropic or equivalent isotropic displacement parameters (Å2)\\n\\nx y z Uiso*/Ueq Occ.

The cell e.s.d.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s. planes.\\n\\nRefinement. Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F2, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F2. The threshold expression of F2 > σ(F2) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R-factors based on ALL data will be even larger.\\n\\nF(000) = 1348.8 Dx = 2.624 Mg m−3 θ = 2.3–28.2° µ = 5.93

Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F2, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F2. The threshold expression of F2 > σ(F2) is used only for calculating R-factors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R-factors based on ALL data will be even larger.\\n\\nFractional atomic coordinates and isotropic or equivalent isotropic displacement parameters (Å2)\\n\\nx y z Uiso*/Ueq Occ.

Lls Institute of Chemistry, University of Wroctaw, 50-383 Wroctaw, ul.Joliot-Curie 14, Poland (Received 15 April 1977; accepted 24 May 1977) Abstract. C6H1406Mn, monoclinic, C2/c, a = 22.857 (9), b = 6.645 (3), c = 14.057 (6) /k, fl = 114.28 (3) ° , M, = 237.12, V = 1946.2 A 3, Z = 8, D m = 1.61, D x = 1.618 g cm-3, g(Mo Ka, 2=0.71069/k) = 14.2 cm -1. The Mn atoms are linked by a bridging system that contains three types of bridges\" a bidentate C2H5COO- group, one O atom from a second propionate group and one water molecule, to give infinite, almost linear, chains parallel to b, with a distorted octahedral Mn coordination and Mn-Mn distances of 3.350 (1) A. The compound shows a temperature-independent magnetic moment very close to the value 5.9 BM (78-295 K). The structure was refined to an R of 0.037 for 1537 diffractometer data.\\n\\nIntroduction. As part of our continuing study on the stereochemistry of Mn-carb\\'oxylate complexes (Lis & Jeiowska-Trzebiatowska, 1977; Lis, Matuszewski & Table 1. The final positional parameters with standard deviations in parentheses Positional parameters are given as fractions of cell edges x 105.\\n\\nThe hydrogen atom positions (x 103) are unrefined.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The hydrogen atom positions (x 103) are unrefined.\\n\\nJeiowska-Trzebiatowska, 1977) our purpose is to establish the relative variability of the mode of Mn 2+ coordination by propionate ligands in the crystalline state. Our study on propionate complexes of Mn in higher valence states will be published later.\\n\\nSingle crystals of the compound were prepared by evaporation of an aqueous mixture of freshly precipitated manganese(II) hydroxide and propionic acid.\\n\\nWeissenberg photographs showed that the crystals are monoclinic; the systematic absences were: hkl for h + k = 2n + 1, hOl for l = 2n + 1 ; space group C2/e or Cc. An irregularly shaped crystal of approximate size 0.2 x 0-3 x 0.15 mm was selected for the data collection.\\n\\nA Syntex P2~ diffractometer and Mo Ka radiation with a graphite monochromator were used for latticeparameter and intensity measurements. The intensities were measured by the 0-20 scan technique. After each group of 40 reflexions the intensity of a standard reflexion was measured and no significant change in intensity was observed. The data were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. Of 1966 accessible reflexions in the range 7.0 < 28 < 53 °, 1537 with I > 1.96a(I) were used for the structure determination. All calculations were performed with the Syntex XTL structure-determination system (NOVA 1200 computer and additional external disc memory). Neutralatom scattering factors used were those listed in International Tables for X-ray Crystallography (1974).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The heavy-atom method was employed for the phase determination. A satisfactory solution was obtained in space group C2/c with the Mn atom in a general position with x ~ ¼, y ~ 0, z ~ ¼. All non-H atoms were found from several Fourier and difference-Fourier syntheses. Full-matrix least-squares refinement first with isotropic, then with anisotropic thermal parameters gave R = 0.083 and 0.047 respectively. A difference-Fourier synthesis at this stage showed all H atoms. Further refinement with fixed parameters for H atoms (for all B = 3.5 /k 2) reduced R to 0.037 and R w to 0-036. The final atomic coordinates and their estimated standard deviations are listed in Table 1.* A final three-dimensional difference-Fourier synthesis was quite featureless.\\n\\nThe crystal structure is depicted in Fig. 1, which also gives the numbering scheme used in the text. The principal bond lengths and angles are presented in Table 2.\\n\\nDiscussion. The crystal structure, which is defined by the unit-cell dimensions, the positional parameters of Table 1, and the space-group symmetry operations, consists of infinite, almost linear chains of Mn ions\\n\\nx y z Mn 23987 (2) 1577 (7) 23995 (4) H20(1) 30749 (11) 25379 (32) 36066 (16) H20(2 ) 17225 (13) 25457 (36) 43938 (20) O(1) 28406 (11) 9353 (32) 13519 (17) 0(2) 30125 (11) 42297 (33) 15638 (18) 0(3) 31670(11) -21175(31) 30268(17) 0(4) 39670 (10) 875 (36) 36273 (18) C(l) 30922 (16) 25304 (50) 12252 (23) C(2) 35344 (18) 24415 (52) 6685 (28) C(3) 42124 (21) 20468 (77) 14345, (38) C(4) 37708 (16) -16515 (49) 34007 (25) C(5) 42394 (18) -3-3471 (57) 35668 (34) C(6) 49326 (20) -27526 (69) 40118 (42) H(I) 341 182 364 H(2) 318 273 432 H(3) 193 364 432 H(4) 193 136 432 H(5) 352 370 23 H(6) 339 110 18 H(7) 410 -410 295 H(8) 412 -445 385 H(9) 420 90 205 H(10) 432 318 182 H(I1) 455 182 114 H(12) 523 -410 409 H(I 3) 500 - 182 477 H(14) 500 - 182 341\\n\\nFig. 1.

The Mn atoms have distorted octahedral geometry and are linked by three different kinds of bridges. It is apparent (Fig. 1) that there are two propionate bridges of different kinds. One type bridges Mn atoms as a bidentate ligand, and in the second propionate group only one O atom is the bridging atom. The Mn-O(propionate) distances vary from 2.125 (3) to 2.208 (2) A. The third bridging group is the H20(1 ) water molecule, giving one longer and one shorter Mn-O bond of 2.369 (2) and 2-223 (2) A, respectively.\\n\\nAll bond lengths and angles in the C2HsCOO- groups are unexceptional. The C--O bond lengths in the bidentate propionate group are equivalent [1.253 (4) and 1.267 (4) A]. The monodentate carboxylate group appears to be unsymmetric, with a C(4)-O(4) bond of 1.233 (5) A, close to the expected double-bond value.\\n\\nIn addition to the polymeric nature of the structure there is a network of hydrogen bonds utilizing the lone water of hydration, H20(2), holding the polymeric units The Mn-Mn distances of 3.350 (1) A indicate that no metal-metal interaction occurs. To investigate the effect of intra-chain superexchange interactions, we have measured the temperature variation of the magnetic susceptibility between 78 and 295 K. The investigated compound has a temperature-independent magnetic moment very close to the spin-only value (5.9 -¥ 0.1 BM), which suggests that there is no superexchange within this temperature range.')]\n",

An anisotropic full-matrix least-squares refinement was performed yielding a final R of 0.044 for the i254 measured reflections. The Ag atoms lie in layers on the (001) faces, making hexagonal networks. The (001)-face inversion centres are situated at the centres of and half-way along the sides of the hexagons; in the layer, an Ag atom has three neighbours at 2.891 (1), 2.905 (1) and 3.276 (1)/~.

Silver(I) 1,4-butanedisulphonate, Ag2[SO a- (CH2)4SO3], crystallizes in space group P21/c with a = 8.699 (3), b = 5.866 (1), c = 8.949 (1)A, fl = 91.75 (1) °, V = 456.5/~a, Z = 2, Dc = 3.14 Mg m -a, /~(Mo KS) -- 4.16 mm -1. With the same technique as above, the final R is 0.052 for the 1101 measured reflections. Similar to the preceding complex, the butanedisulphonato ligand also has 1 symmetry and is close to 2/m symmetry, but the distribution and coordination of the Ag atoms are quite different. They are located around 21 axes, and are connected by the ligands in such a manner that the Ag coordination polyhedron is a very distorted trigonal bipyramid [Ag-O bonds: 2.384 (4) to 2.577 (6),/~]. Finally, no Ag-Ag distance is very short [Ag...Agmi n = 3.202 (1) A].\\n\\nIntroduetion'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Introduetion\\n\\nPoursuivant r&ude des complexes de l'argent(I) avec divers eoordinats dont les acides n-alcanemonosul0567-7408/81/040822-05501.00 foniques ou a,o>disulfoniques, nous d6crivons les structures cristallines de l'&hanedisulfonate-l,2 d'argent(I) et du butanedisulfonate-l,4 d'argent(I) o~ l'on constate entre elles de grandes diff6rences dans la distribution et la coordination de l'argent.\\n\\nLes modes de pr6paration et de purification des acides correspondants ont 6t6 publi6s ant6rieurement (Charbonnier, 1971).

The C-O distances vary between 1.229 and 1.253/1 , while individual Ca-O lengths are between 2.425 and 2.469 A. The hydrogen-bond network appears to control the planarity of oxalate (I) as well as structural stability.\\n\\nIntroduction\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Introduction\\n\\nWhewellite (CaC 204. H20) is found in sediments, plants, animals, and is a major constituent of human urinary calculi. Whewellite, weddellite [CAC204.(2 + x)H20 with x < 0.5] and calcium oxalate trihydrate (CaC204.3H20) have been generally accepted to 0567-7408/81/040826-04501.00 represent the polymorphism of the hydrates of calcium oxalate. The crystal structure of wheweUite was originally studied by Cocco (1962) and Cocco & Sabelli (1962), and recently reexamined by Tazzoli & Domeneghetti (1980) and Deganello & Piro (1981). The crystal structure of weddellite was proposed by Sterling (1965) and refined by Tazzoli & Domeneghetti (1980). The structure of calcium oxalate trihydrate has likewise recently been determined (Deganello, Kampf & Moore, 1981). Since then, the existence of yet another polymorph has been demonstrated (DeganeUo, 1980). Precession photographs of whewellite taken at high temperature showed the existence of both a basic* structure (stability range _ 318-425 K) and a derivative structure (stability range ~_ 293\"~-318K). Transition from the former to the latter takes place\\n\\nSince the high- and low-temperature form conform to the topogeometrical criteria discussed by Buerger (1947), the terminology, basic structure and derivative structure proposed by that author will be used in this paper.\\n\\n\"[\" This figure is only indicative since no information is available regarding low-temperature work.\\n\\n© 1981 International Union of Crystallography')]\n",

The layers, which contain in®nite puckered four-membered LaÐOÐLaÐO rings in a pseudo-ternary symmetry, are formed by the lanthanum and one independent malonate group. They are interconnected by the second independent malonate group, giving a threedimensional framework in which wide channels accommodate one disordered water molecule of crystallization. The La atom lies on a twofold axis and is ten-coordinated by eight O atoms from carboxylate groups and two water molecules. One malonate group is monodentate and triply bridging chelating, whilst the other is doubly monodentate. The extensive network of hydrogen bonds and bridge bonds observed in this structure enhances the structural stability. Despite some identical subfeatures, this structure is quite different from that observed in [La2(C3H2O4)3(H2O)3]2H2O.\\n\\nComment'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Comment\\n\\nIn the binary complexes of lanthanides with malonic acid, there are three different isostructural series characterized by the number of water molecules and the lanthanoid cation (Hansson, 1973a). For the complexes of lanthanum, two structural studies have been published, one containing malonate ions (Marrot & Trombe, 1993) and the other both malonate and hydrogen malonate ions as ligands (Marrot & Trombe, 1994). The complex [La2(C3H2O4)3]5H2O was presented as showing two different phases in the monoclinic system and the structure of one of these phases, (I), is the subject of the present publication, only its space group and unit-cell dimensions having been reported previously. Our overall goal is to improve the conditions of the synthesis leading to a pure single phase and to investigate the factors enhancing the stability of solid dicarboxylate lanthanides as a function of the chain length of the carboxylic acid molecule.\\n\\nThe general features of the structure, without the hydrogen bonding, are shown in Fig. 1. There are two crystallographically independent malonate ligands; L1, of point symmetry 1, and L2, of point symmetry 2. The three-dimen-'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"sional packing of the ligand complexes is essentially built from a two-dimensional substructure. Indeed, the structure can be described in terms of a layer-type polymeric structure built up from lanthanum±malonate L1 layers parallel to (100), including puckered four-membered LaÐOÐLaÐO rings running in a zigzag manner along the b axis. Each La atom is surrounded by three such rings in a pseudo-ternary symmetry. These layers are connected together through L2 malonates to form the three-dimensional network. The resulting packing shows wide channels parallel to the b axis surrounded by the carbon backbone chain of the L2 malonates and by the O atoms of the coordinating water molecules. Of the two and a half nominal water molecules in each asymmetric unit, two are coordinated to the La atom as intra-layer water and the rest located in a disordered fashion in the channels and not coordinated to lanthanum.\\n\\nA view of the ten-coordination around the La atom is shown in Fig. 2. The ten coordinating O atoms are made up of seven from four L1 malonates, one from one L2 malonate and two from two water molecules. One of the L1 malonates is monodentate through the O2A atom and the other three are chelating, one involving a six-membered chelate ring (called the `malonate' mode). Moreover, each O atom in L1 coordinates to two La atoms leading to bridging interactions, except for O4A which only coordinates to one La atom. As a result, there are two kinds of four-membered rings: one is the LaÐOÐCÐO chelate ring formed by the bidentate coordi- Figure 1\\n\\nA projection of the crystal structure of (I) along the b axis.

Across this latter, the closest distance between two La3+ ions is 4.5479 (4) AÊ . Each L1 malonate is surrounded by four La atoms, while the L2 malonate, which is doubly monodentate, bridges two La atoms. The two metal-bonded O atoms in this ligand are trans as a consequence of its twofold symmetry. Despite this feature, and the fact that the malonate ligand is less sterically demanding than other dicarboxylates, the coordination polyhedron is a very distorted bicapped dodecahedron. This is probably due to the large distortions imposed by the bite angles which are considerably smaller [46.90 (5) and 48.41 (6)] than those found in other malonate compounds (Tapparo et al., 1996; Barbaro et al., 1997) as a consequence of the two coordinating water molecules which are far from a trans coordination, the angle between them being 134.07 (7).\\n\\nWithin the layers described above, each polyhedron shares three common edges (O1AÐO2A, O1AiÐO2Ai and O3AÐ O3Aii; see Table 1 for symmetry codes) with three adjacent polyhedra.\\n\\nThe distances and angles in the two independent ligands and the LaÐO bond lengths agree with those found in analogous compounds (Marrot & Trombe, 1993, 1994), with one LaÐO bond being considerably longer. This kind of distance seems to be rather typical of the chelating carboxylate group (Hansson, 1973a,b).\\n\\nAll water molecules are involved in an extensive network of hydrogen bonds amongst themselves and with the non-bridging O atoms of the ligands (O2B and O4A).

This explains why all known well de®ned crystalline dicarboxylate lanthanides are hydrated, except for one complex of neodymium (Hansson, 1973c) and one of gadolinium (Trollet et al., 1997).\\n\\nA comparison with other recently reported dicarboxylate lanthanides (Wen Mei et al., 1992; Serpaggi & FeÂrey, 1998; Serpaggi et al., 1999) reveals that all these structures contain the same structural subfeature, including four-membered rings. However, the phase [La2(C3H2O4)3(H2O)3]2H2O reported earlier (Marrot & Trombe, 1993) is quite different as two crystallographically independent La atoms are present. One is coordinated to nine malonate O atoms and one water molecule, whilst the other is bonded to eight malonate O atoms and two water molecules. Moreover the three independent malonate ligands exhibit different coordination modes including a triply monodentate mode.\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nThe preparation procedure is comparable to that used by Marrot & Trombe (1993), with carefully controlled pH (4) and temperature (353 K).

The CdII atoms are each coordinated by four N atoms from two pyridine ligands and two thiocyanato anions, each in a mutually cis orientation, and by two S atoms from two adjacent thiocyanato anions within a slightly distorted octahedral coordination environment. The CdII atoms are -1,3bridged via the thiocyanato anions into polymeric chains parallel to [001].

During these investigations, we have prepared several compounds using pyrazine derivatives such as 2-methylpyrazine or 2-chloropyrazine (NaÈther et al., 2001, 2002). In further investigations, we have prepared coordination polymers with 2-iodopyrazine. With CuI, we have found two polymorphic modi®cations of CuI(2-iodopyrazine) (NaÈther et al., 2003).

The ligand acts both as a chelate, forming ®ve-membered rings, and as a bridge between two U atoms. The coordination around each U atom is a distorted hexagonal bipyramid. In®nite chains running along [001] are formed via bridging salicylhydroxamate O atoms. The chains have C2 symmetry, with U atoms in special positions on twofold axes. The water molecules are not coordinated to the metal but crosslink, through hydrogen bonding, adjacent coordination polymer chains in the [110] and [110] directions.\\n\\nComment\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Comment\\n\\nActinide compounds show great structural variety and complexity, owing to the implication of 5f orbitals in the formation of chemical bonds, and in recent years they have been studied in the search for new materials with peculiar optical, magnetic and catalytic properties (Hutchings et al., 1996; Francis et al., 1998; Bean et al., 2001). In this context, a promising area is that of metal±organic coordination polymers built up from UÐO units. For these materials, interesting electronic (e.g. semiconducting) and optical properties are foreseen (Chen et al., 2003). Up to now, only a few examples of uranyl coordination polymers have been reported. In some cases, the polymers contain an additional metal besides uranium (Chen et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2004) and, moreover, they are generally based on more than one type of ligand (ThueÂry, 2007).\\n\\nDuring a study of complex formation equilibria between metal ions and salicylhydroxamic acid, we succeeded in the synthesis of the title compound, (I), which is a rare example of a uranyl coordination polymer containing uranium as the only metal and based on only one type of ligand, here 2-hydroxybenzohydroxamate (or salicylhydroxamate), the water molecules not being coordinated to the metal.\\n\\nThe hydroxamate group occurs in natural products having'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The hydroxamate group occurs in natural products having\\n\\nbiological activity (Kehl, 1982); some are inhibitors of enzymes such as peroxidases, metalloproteinases and ureases. The biological effects have been attributed to the af®nity of the hydroxamate anion for metal ions. Actually, X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the salicylhydroxamate group behaves as an O,O0-bidentate ligand, forming a ®vemembered chelate ring with several transition metal ions. All Figure 1 A view of part of the coordination polymer of (I), showing the atom numbering. Displacement ellipsoids are drawn at the 30% probability level. The water molecule has been omitted for clarity. [Symmetry codes: (i) ÿx + 12, ÿy + 12, z; (ii) ÿx + 12, y, z ÿ 12; (iii) x, ÿy + 12, z ÿ 12.] metal complexes of this ligand reported to date, however, have a mononuclear structure (Comman , 1992; Sharipov , 1983; Gao et al., 1998) and only one has a dinuclear structure (Stemmler et al., 1995). This report is the ®rst in which the salicylhydroxamate ligand is involved in the formation of a coordination polymer.\\n\\nThe crystallographically independent unit of (I) contains one-half of a uranyl group, where atom U1 sits on a C2 axis, one salicylhydroxamate unit and one water molecule (Fig. 1). The conformation of the ligand shows, as expected, the 2-hydroxy group (C3ÐO3) and the C1ÐN1 bond in a syn conformation in order to establish an intramolecular hydrogen bond (Table 2). The carbonyl O atom is coordinated to one U atom only, while the hydroxamate O atom acts as a slightly asymmetric bridge between two U atoms. The bond geometry around the hydroxamate O atoms is substantially trigonal planar (Table 1).\\n\\nThe coordination environment of uranyl contains two chelate ®ve-atom rings and four bridging O atoms (Fig. 1).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The coordination environment of uranyl contains two chelate ®ve-atom rings and four bridging O atoms (Fig. 1).\\n\\nEach chelate ring is planar within 0.056 (4) AÊ , and the two rings and the U atom are coplanar within 0.101 (6) AÊ . This coordination can be described as a distorted hexagonal bipyramid, with axial O uranyl atoms (Cotton et al., 2005). The distortion is mainly due to the -O atoms being 0.588 (7) AÊ above and 0.588 (7) AÊ below the average plane of atom U1 and the two chelate rings.\\n\\nIn the crystal structure, the bridging of the U atoms by the salicylhydroxamate ligands leads to in®nite chains running Figure 2 The crystal packing of (I), viewed along c. The benzene H atoms have been omitted for clarity and hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines.\\n\\nparallel to [001] (Figs. 1 and 2), whose direction coincides with the macroscopic elongation axis of the prismatic single crystals. The chains are formed, via bridging hydroxamate O atoms, through the two c-glide planes and, because those glide planes are mutually perpendicular, the chains have overall C2 symmetry about the U1 atoms. Owing to the distorted coordination geometry around the U atom, adjacent chelate rings along the direction of the chain axis are not coplanar [the dihedral angle is 37.2 (1)], thus relieving the overcrowding of the benzene groups.\\n\\nThe water molecules are not coordinated to the metal atoms; they are located between adjacent coordination polymer chains and crosslink them in the [110] and [110] directions, thereby contributing to the stability of the crystal packing by completing a three-dimensional framework. The water molecule is involved as an acceptor of a hydrogen bond from the 2-hydroxy group of a neighbouring salicylhydroxamate ligand and as a donor in weaker hydrogen bonds with atoms O2 and O4 of symmetry-related units (Table 2).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Finally, we stress the relevant feature of the structure of (I) as compared with the few polymeric structures of uranyl reported to date, i.e. that all O atoms coordinated to the uranyl group belong to the organic ligand. Thus, in principle, it could be possible to in¯uence the metal-to-ligand electronic system (and hence the spectroscopic properties) by introducing suitable substituents onto the aromatic ring (e.g. electronwithdrawing groups, such as nitro or cyano, or electronreleasing groups, such as dialkylamino).\\n\\nExperimental'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Experimental\\n\\nCompound (I) was prepared from uranium(VI) perchlorate, 2-hydroxybenzohydroxamic acid and sodium perchlorate. Stock solutions of uranium(VI) perchlorate, perchloric acid and sodium perchlorate were obtained as described previously (Ciavatta et al., 1979). Commercial 2-hydroxybenzohydroxamic acid (Sigma± Aldrich) was recrystallized twice from methanol±water mixtures (Ciavatta et al., 2004). A solution of 0.005 mol dmÿ3 2-hydroxybenzohydroxamic acid, 0.002 mol dmÿ3 uranium(VI) perchlorate and 1 mol dmÿ3 sodium perchlorate was neutralized quantitatively by the addition of 0.05 mol dmÿ3 NaOH. Subsequently, the acidity of the solution was increased slowly by addition of 0.02 mol dmÿ3 perchloric acid, until incipient precipitation of an orange±red solid. All operations were performed in a thermostatted vessel at 298.00 (5) K. The solutions were purged using a continuous stream of pure nitrogen. The resulting solid, which developed as aggregates of elongated prismatic crystals, was separated from the solution by ®ltration, washed with 1 mol dmÿ3 sodium perchlorate then with water, and ®nally dried under vacuum at room temperature. Compound (I) was identi®ed by IR spectroscopy and chemical and thermal analysis. An intense IR band at 914±930 cmÿ1 was observed, which is typical of asymmetric O U O uranyl stretching; typical amide C O stretching at 1600 cmÿ1 was also observed. The composition of the solid was determined by thermogravimetric analysis under a nitrogen gas atmosphere, within the temperature range 323±1073 K, after which the transformation to U3O8 was complete.

All other H atoms were located in a difference map. All H atoms were re®ned using a riding model, with Uiso(H) values equal to Ueq of the carrier atom. The following feature of the diffraction pattern of (I) has not escaped our attention. Since the U atoms lie in special positions on twofold axes, their contribution to hkl re¯ections with odd l is zero. However, uranium alone accounts for a large fraction of the overall electronic density of the compound (32%), so it follows that re¯ections of hkl layers with odd l have intensities systematically lower than layers with even l. This fraction of low-intensity re¯ections may account for the relatively high Rint value.\\n\\nData collection: COLLECT (Nonius, 1999); cell re®nement: DIRAX/LSQ (Duisenberg et al., 2000); data reduction: EVALCCD (Duisenberg et al., 2003); program(s) used to solve structure: SIR97 (Altomare et al., 1999); program(s) used to re®ne structure: SHELXL97 (Sheldrick, 1997); molecular graphics: ORTEP-3 for Windows (Farrugia, 1997); software used to prepare material for publication: WinGX (Farrugia, 1999).\\n\\nWe thank Professor L.

Among various organic ligands, some of the most useful are neutral pyridyl-containing bidentate or multidentate ligands, because of their simple bridging  mode  and  ability  to  form  strong  coordination compounds with transition metal ions (Hagrman et al., 1999; Kitagawa & Konda,1998; MacGillivray et al., 1994). Many rigid rod-like bipyridyl ligands have been employed for the rational design of solid-state architectures of coordination polymers. For example, Biradha and colleagues have designed a series of rigid bipyridyl ligands by increasing the number of phenyl rings between pyridyl rings, thereby obtaining two-dimen sional square frameworks of different sizes through assembly of these ligands with metal ions (Biradha & Fujita, 2000; Biradha et al., 2000). Flexible bridging ligands have received less attention than rigid ligands because of the dif®culties inherent in predicting the structure of the ®nal product, although ¯exibility and conformational freedom provide the probability  of  producing  some  unique  frameworks  with beautiful aesthetics and useful properties (Belcher et al., 2002; Paz et al., 2002).

We report here the synthesis and characterization of the title one-dimensional zigzag chain complex [Zn(bpmp)Cl2]n, (I).\\n\\nSingle-crystal X-ray analysis reveals that (I) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c and forms a one-dimensional zigzag chain through interconnection of ZnCl2 units and bpmp. The polymeric chain structure is generated by the action of the crystallographic twofold axis. As shown in Fig. 1, each ZnII ion is coordinated by two N atoms from different bpmp moieties and two terminal Clÿ ions in a distorted tetrahedral environment. The ZnÐN and ZnÐCl bond distances are 2.061 (3) and 2.2139 (11) AÊ , respectively. The Cl1ÐZnÐCli (symmetry code as in Table 1) bond angle of 123.02 (7) is larger than the N1ÐZnÐN1i bond angle of 102.13 (16), probably to minimize the ClCl interaction.\\n\\nThe dihedral angle between the two pyridyl rings attached to ZnII is 82.4, indicating that they are approximately perpendicular to one another. Bpmp behaves in an exo-bidentate mode, with the two pyridyl rings in bpmp being parallel to each other. The piperazine connector adopts a stable chair conformation. Thus, bpmp connects ZnCl2 units into a onedimensional polymeric chain (Fig. 2), with a ZnZn separation of 16.57 AÊ . There are no other noteworthy short contacts or weak interactions between adjacent chains (Fig. 3).\\n\\nExperimental'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Experimental\\n\\nThe bpmp ligand was synthesized according to the method of Niu et al.

The reaction mixture was heated to 333 K and added dropwise to dimethylformamide (about 1 ml) until the precipitate dissolved.

They are linked into chains of R22(8) rings (Bernstein et al., 1995) by means of NÐ HO hydrogen bonds (Degeilh & Marsh, 1959; Sarangarajan et al., 2005), and these chains are themselves linked into sheets by CÐHO hydrogen bonds (Sarangarajan et al., 2005). In the hydrogen-bonded adducts formed by piperazine-2,5-dione with simple monocarboxylic acids, the same chain of R22(8) rings occurs, with the acid units pendant from it (Kartha et al., 1981; Luo & Palmore, 2002), while with dicarboxylic acids or phenolic monocarboxyic acids these chains are linked into sheets (Luo & Palmore, 2002; Sarangarajan et al., 2005). Unusually, the adduct formed with salicylic acid contains neither chains nor sheets but ®nite centrosymmetric aggregates of two acid molecules and one piperazinedione unit (Varughese & Kartha, 1982). Despite the substantial number of hydrogen-bonded adducts formed with organic acids, very little structural information is available for metal complexes of piperazine-2,5-dione. However, closely-related 1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,5-dione forms a ®nite encapsulation complex with aluminium tris(2,6-diphenylphenoxide) (Ooi et al., 1998), and the same amide forms a one-dimensional coordination polymer with Ph2SnCl2 (Kovala-Demertzi et al., 1995). We report here the structures of four adducts, (I)±(IV) (Figs. 1±4), formed by piperazine-2.5-dione when it is cocrystallized from aqueous solutions containing simple salts of CoII, NiII, CuII and AgI.\\n\\nCompounds (I) and (II) are isomorphous.

In these struc-\\n\\ntures, the metal atom lies at a centre of inversion in the space group P21/n, selected as that at (12, 12, 12), and it is coordinated by two Cl and four water ligands. Within the selected asymmetric unit, the centrosymmetric piperidinedione component is linked to the neutral [MCl2(H2O)4] unit (M = Co or Ni) by a combination of OÐHO and NÐHCl hydrogen bonds (Table 3), such that the organic component lies across the centre of inversion at (12, 0, 0) (Figs. 1 and 2). In each complex, the coordination of the metal atom has symmetry very close to D4h (4/mmm), with the bond angles subtended at the metal atoms by pairs of cis ligands all within 3 of 90. The MÐO and MÐCl distances are slightly smaller in (II) than in (I) (Table 1).\\n\\nAll of the OÐH and NÐH bonds within the structures of (I) and (II) are involved in hydrogen bonding (Table 3) and the components are thereby linked into a three-dimensional framework structure.

Within the coordination polymer chain, the centrosymmetric Cu2Cl2 units contain two signi®cantly different CuÐCl distances (Table 1). A similar chain, with CuÐCl distances of 2.2724 (13) and 3.1537 (14) AÊ , is present in benzimidazolium tetrachlorocuprate monohydrate [Cambridge Structural Database (Allen, 2002) refcode FUTRUH; Bukowska-StrzyzÇewska & Skoweranda, 1987]. More frequently, however, [CuCl2(H2O)2] units are found as isolated square-planar units, as in NPYOCU (Williams et al., 1971) and TPPOCU (Dunaj- Jurco et al., 1979), or as square-planar units weakly coordinated by two further axial ligands, as in UGAYUW (Giantsidis et al., 2002). The hydrogen bonds in (III) link the reference Cu atom at (14, 1 4, 1 4), via the piperazinedione units centred at (0, 0, 1 2), (0, ÿ12, 0), (12, 1 2, 0) and (12, 1, 1 2), respectively, to the Cu atoms at (ÿ14, ÿ14, 3 4), (ÿ14, ÿ54, ÿ14), (34, 3 4, ÿ14) and (34, 7 4, 3 4), so forming a sheet'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='units centred at (0, 0, 1 2), (0, ÿ12, 0), (12, 1 2, 0) and (12, 1, 1 2), respectively, to the Cu atoms at (ÿ14, ÿ14, 3 4), (ÿ14, ÿ54, ÿ14), (34, 3 4, ÿ14) and (34, 7 4, 3 4), so forming a sheet parallel to (211) (Fig. 7). In this manner, the reference coordination polymer chain along (14, y, 1 4), is directly linked to the four chains along (ÿ14, y, ÿ14), (ÿ14, y, 3 4), (34, y, ÿ14) and (34, y, 34), thereby generating a three-dimensional framework structure.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Complex (IV), derived from Ag(NO3), is a coordination polymer, [Ag(NO3)(DKP)]n, containing ®ve-coordinate Ag.\\n\\nThe compound crystallizes in the space group Pnma, and the Ag+ ions and all the atoms of the nitrate anions lie on mirror planes, while the DKP units lie across centres of inversion.

Propagation of these interactions then leads to the formation of an (010) sheet built from a single type of 12membered ring (Fig. 8).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='In addition to the three O atoms from within the ionic layer, the Ag+ ion at (x, 14, z) is also coordinated by two O atoms from two different DKP ligands, namely those at (x, y, z) and (x, 1 2 ÿ y, z). The coordination polyhedron around the Ag+ ion is best described as a distorted square pyramid (Fig. 4) in which two of the basal AgÐO distances are signi®cantly longer than the other pair (Table 2). The two independent OÐAgÐO angles in the basal plane have values close to 90, while the angles subtended at Ag by the axial O and one of the basal O sites range from 74.94 (6) to 114.11 (6). The atoms of type O12 at (x, y, z) and (x, 12 ÿ y, z) form part of the DKP units centred at (12, 12, 0) and (12, 0, 0), respectively, so that propagation of this AgÐO interaction by re¯ection and inversion generates a chain running parallel to the [010] direction (Fig. 9) which serves to link all of the (010) layers into a threedimensional coordination polymer. The three-dimensional framework is reinforced by a single NÐHO hydrogen bond.\\n\\nThus, in each of compounds (I) and (II) there is a ®nite [MCl2(H2O)4] fragment, in compound (III) there is a onedimensional coordination polymer, [CuCl2(H2O)2]n, and in compound (IV) there is a three-dimensional coordination polymer, [Ag(NO3)(DKP)]n. In (I) and (II), the formation of the three-dimensional framework is dependent upon the actions of multiple hydrogen bonds, while in compound (IV) the framework is formed by the three-dimensional coordination polymer, to the formation of which the single hydrogen bond is incidental. The three-dimensional framework in (III) is of a hybrid type, depending upon hydrogen bonds to link the one-dimensional coordination polymer chains.

The propane-1,3-diaminium cation is not incorporated in this crystal structure. The SrII atom lies on an inversion centre and is eight-coordinated by four O atoms from three py-3,5-dc ligands and four O atoms from four coordinated water molecules. The coordination polyhedron of the SrII atom is a distorted dodecahedron. These binuclear units are connected via the carboxylate O atoms to build a one-dimensional polymeric chain. In the crystal structure, non-covalant interactions consisting of hydrogen bonds (X— HO, with X = O and C) and –- stacking interactions [3.4604 (19) A˚ ] connect the various components to form a supramolecular structure.\\n\\nRelated Literature\\n\\nFor related literature, see: Aghabozorg et al.

The title compound is a member of a series of crystal structures of Cr m complexes with iminodiacetic acid and different alkyl residues R at the N atom: [Cr{RN(CH2COO)2}2]-. In all structures the influence of the residue on the geometry of the octahedral environment of the Cr atom, in particular the choice between a cis and a trans configuration for the two N atoms, is of interest. The smallest substituent R = H yielded a cis configuration (Mootz & Wunderlich, 1980a), while R = i-C3H 7 shows a trans configuration (Mootz & Wunderlich, 1980b).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"The anion of the title compound with main bond lengths is given in Fig. 1, the corresponding bond angles are listed in Table 3. In agreement with the point symmetry [ of the anion, the configuration is trans. The spacious alkyl residue and ring constraints determine the geometry of the molecule. The octahedral coordination of the Cr atom deviates by up to 11.3 ° from ideal angles. The Cr-O bond lengths of 1.953 and 1.974 A agree with the values for the other structures of this series, but the Cr-N distance is elongated because of the size of the substituent at the N atom: 2-058 and 2.070 (R = H), 2. 118 (R = i-C3H7), and 2.152 A (R = tert-C4Hg). The increase can be followed spectroscopically through its weakening influence on the ligand field (Wernicke, Schmidtke & Hoggard, 1977) and is confirmed in the discussion of the crystal structure of rubidium bis(pyridine-2,6dicarboxylato)chromate(III) (Ffirst, Gouzerh & Jeannin, 1979). The two symmetry-independent fivemembered rings deviate by up to 0.2 [involving O(1)] and 0.3 A [involving 0(2)] from planarity. The angles at the tetrahedral N atoms range from 102.1 to 1 19.0 °.

(1966). We describe here a more precise low-temperature redetermination of this crystal structure, where R = 0.017 in this work versus R = 0.148 in the previous report, and discuss the structure in the context of supramolecular chemistry. The LiÐ Cl interaction is also of particular interest due to the wide range of aggregated forms that have been discovered for this apparently simple combination. Previously characterized LiÐ Cl complexes with neutral Lewis bases include monomers, dimers, tetramers, polymers, three-dimensional arrays and ion pairs (Chivers et al., 2001).\\n\\nX-ray analysis of (I) revealed a three-dimensional\\n\\ndiamondoid network, where lithium acts as a tetrahedral node that is bridged by the `linear' linkers chloride and dioxane. Fig. 1 presents the asymmetric unit and Fig. 2 shows the extended structure. Variations from the ideal tetrahedral angles around the lithium center give rise to the distorted diamondoid topology.

Dioxane was purchased from Lancaster, distilled from CaH2 and stored over 4 AÊ molecular sieve before use. n-Butyllithium (1.6 M solution in hexane) was purchased from Aldrich and standardized prior to use. 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol was purchased from Alfa Aesar and dried by recrystallization prior to use. The NMR spectroscopic data were recorded on a Varian Unity Plus 300 spectrometer at 298 K. For the synthesis of (I), n-BuLi (5 mmol of a 1.6 M solution in hexane) was added to a solution of trichlorophenol (5 mmol) in dioxane (6.5 ml). Upon stirring, a white precipitate formed, which was redissolved by heating the solution to re¯ux.

Both Zn cations have the Zn atoms an inversion centres and present tetragonally distorted octahedral environments, but differences in their linkage through the 3pdb and 4pdb ligands give rise to differently shaped weakly interacting chains.\\n\\nComment'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Comment\\n\\nThe exobidentate bis-pyridyl ligand 1,4-bis(4-pyridyl)-2,3diazabuta-1,3-diene (4pdb) has been reported to form coordination polymers with several metal centres (CoII, CdII, NiII, AgI, MnII and PbII) containing diverse counter-ions (NO3 ÿ, SCNÿ, Iÿ and saccharinate) (Ciurtin et al., 2001; Kallil et al., 2005; Shen, 2003; Shi, Li, Li et al., 2002; Shi, Li, Tong et al., 2002). These polymeric complexes usually present interesting structural topologies, but recently it has been reported that the reaction of zinc perchlorate hexahydrate with the bis-pyridyl ligand 4pdb, under mild conditions, results in the formation of a non-polymeric compound, viz. Zn(4pdb)2(MeOH)2- (H2O)224pdb1.72MeOH1.28H2O (Shoshnik et al., 2005), hereafter (III), with a [2+2+2]-octahedral coordination environment around the zinc ion and a trans con®guration of the related coordinated species 4pdb, MeOH and H2O.\\n\\nThus, the pyridyl N atoms of two molecules of 4pdb are bonded axially to the solvated cationic fragment [Zn- (MeOH)2(H2O)2] 2+, giving rise to a linear NÐZnIIÐN oligomer. The pyridyl rings of adjacent oligomers are ordered in a such a way as to promote ± stacking interactions.\\n\\nIn the present work, we report on the structural differences found when the neutral ligands providing the O-donor atoms to the [Zn(MeOH)2(H2O)2] 2+ oligomer core in (III) (viz.\\n\\nwater and methanol) are replaced by a different O-donor ligand, the -diketonate acetylacetonate (acac), through the Zn(acac)2 complex. In contrast to the above [Zn(Me- OH)2(H2O)2] 2+ dication, the reaction product of Zn(acac)2 with the divergent 4pdb ligand is a polymeric species, [Zn(acac)2(4pdb)]n, (I). As a comparison with the 4pdb case, the 3-pyridyl isomer 1,4-bis(3-pyridyl)-2,3-diazabuta-1,3-diene (3pdb) was also included in this study. The resulting coordination polymer, [Zn(acac)2(3pdb)]n, (II), shows that the 3pdb ligand likewise acts as a spacer, with the Zn(acac)2 complex as a node.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Figs. 1 and 2 show ellipsoid plots for (I) and (II), respec-\\n\\ntively; Tables 1 and 2, in turn, give selected coordination bond lengths and angles. The structures are built up around two non-equivalent symmetry centres, one at the cation position and the other bisecting the NÐN bond in the 3pdb or 4pdb unit. Both compounds present tetragonally distorted octahedral environments around Zn, with the O atoms of two chelating acac groups in the equatorial positions and the pyridyl N atoms as apices. Structure (I) shows a slightly larger departure from ideal C4v geometry, both in the ZnÐO lengths and in the OÐZnÐN angles (see Table 1), with a slightly larger apical deviation from the normal to the mean equatorial plane [178.5 (1) versus 179.9 (1)]. While the ZnÐN bond distances in the two compounds [2.2689 (17) AÊ in (I) and 2.271 (3) AÊ in (II)] are very similar, they are signi®cantly longer than the corresponding bond in the related ZnII complex, (III), where the ZnÐN bond length is 2.120 (2) AÊ .\\n\\nThis enlargement could be attributed to a less attractive effect towards the metal centre, due to an increase of its negative charge when the neutral ligands (water and methanol) are replaced by the anionic acac. On the other hand, a shortening of the ZnÐO distances should be expected in the polymeric complexes considering the charge effect of the acac anion, which implies a stronger interaction of the acetylacetonate O atoms than those of the water and methanol molecules. In fact, this is actually observed; the ZnÐO lengths for (I) and (II) lie in the range 2.0328 (13)±2.0617 (13) AÊ compared with a range of 2.0977 (18)±2.1642 (19) AÊ in (III). In both cases, the structures organize as chains [running along [211] and [201]'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='for (I) and (II), respectively], where the bridging links are the 4pdb and 3pdb ligands. These are, in turn, responsible for the different geometries observed in the one-dimensional structures, through the diverse disposition of their N atoms and the associated differences in binding modes. In fact, while in (II) the lateral N3 bite of the 3pdb ligand generates zigzag chains, the more linear 4pdb ligand gives rise to very straight onedimensional chains in (I). This difference can be assessed quantitatively by considering the angle between the apical axis in each coordination polyhedron and the direction of maximum span of the corresponding 4pdb or 3pdb connecting ligands, viz. almost linear in (I) [172.1 (1)] and quite broken in (II) [128.2 (1)] (see Figs. 3 and 4).\\n\\nThe two structures are similar in favouring the aggregation of chains related by a [100] shift, suggesting some kind of two-dimensional structure parallel to (011) in the case of (I) and to (010) in (II).

Hydrogen bonding'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='acid + oxine). In metal sulfoxinates, in addition to the usual bidentate chelation of the oxine moiety through the N and O atoms, sulfonic O atoms also coordinate to the metal. Hydrogen bonding patterns and metal-binding modes of sulfoxinates are of current interest (Cai, Chen, Liao, Feng & Chen, 2001; Cai, Chen, Liao, Yao et al., 2001; Cai, Chen, Feng et al., 2001). It has recently been demonstrated that the combination of coordi nation and the sulfonate group can result in the formation of strong supramolecular aggregates through hydrogen bonding and this represents a new strategy for the design of SHG (second harmonic generation) materials (Xie et al., 2002). Information on the structural chemistry of metal sulfoxinates is relatively rare, due to the poor coordinating ability of sulfoxinates compared with that of phosphonates. Various remarkable structural features of metal sulfoxinates have prompted  us  to  investigate  systematically  the  structural chemistry of these compounds. The crystal structures of 7- iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic  acid  (ferron;  Balasu bramanian & Muthiah, 1996a), 7-nitro-8-hydroxyquinoline-5- sulfonic acid monohydrate (Balasubramanian & Muthiah, 1996b), the  cobalt complex  of ferron (Balasubramanian, 1995), the nickel complex of 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid (HQS; Baskar Raj et al., 2001), the nickel complex of ferron (Baskar Raj et al., 2002) and the lithium complex of # 2002 International Union of Crystallography HQS (Murugesan & Muthiah, 1997) have also been reported Printed in Great Britain ± all rights reserved from our laboratory.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Received 19 August 2002 Accepted 21 August 2002 Online 13 September 2002 In metal sulfoxinates, the sulfonate motifs can be linked in\\n\\ntwo ways. In one type, in addition to the usual bidentate chelation of the oxine motif, two centrosymmetrically related monomers are bridged by one of the sulfonate O atoms involved in the coordination, forming a cage-like dimer, as observed in the copper±sulfoxinate complexes (Petit, Coquerel et al., 1993; Petit, Ammor et al., 1993), the cobalt complex of ferron (Balasubramanian, 1995), the nickel complex of ferron (Baskar Raj et al., 2002) and the lithium complex of HQS (Murugesan & Muthiah, 1997). In another type, in addition to the usual bidentate chelation, a sulfonic acid O atom of one molecule is coordinated to the metal atom of another molecule, leading to a one-dimensional polymeric arrangement, as observed in the copper±sulfoxinate complex (Petit, Coquerel et al., 1993).\\n\\nIn the sodium complex of HQS, (I), the coordination\\n\\ngeometry around the sodium ion is distorted trigonal bipyramidal.

The O atom of the quinolinol moiety and one of the O atoms (O3) from the sulfonate group bind to the Na+ ion at the axial positions and two O atoms (O2 and O4) from two different sulfonate groups and the ring N atom lie in the equatorial positions. A view of the complex unit of (I), with the atom-labelling scheme, is shown in Fig. 1. One of the sulfonate O atoms bridges the two inversion-related monomers, leading to a cage-like dimeric unit (Fig. 2). The distance between two neighbouring Na atoms is 5.4718 (15) AÊ . A view of the packing is shown in Fig. 3. The present sodium complex is quite different from other metal sulfoxinates reported in the literature (Balasubramanian, 1995; Murugesan & Muthiah, 1997; Petit, Coquerel et al., 1993; Petit, Ammor et al., 1993; Baskar Raj et al., 2001, 2002) in the sense that all three sulfonate O atoms are involved in the coordination, leading to a supramolecular network structure. The smaller NÐNaÐO bite angle in (I) may be the result of longer coordination bonds than those in the Co and Ni complexes. The NaÐ O(quinolinol) and NaÐN(ring) bond distances are not signi®cantly different from one another. The NaÐN(ring) distance [2.4418 (15) AÊ ] in (I) agrees with the range of values [2.459 (7)±2.539 (6) AÊ ] reported in the literature (Papadimitriou et al., 1998). Also, the NaÐO(quinolinol) distance [2.4892 (14) AÊ ] in (I) agrees with the corresponding distance [2.42 (9) AÊ ] in small molecules (Harding, 2002) reported in the Cambridge Structural Database (Allen & Kennard, 1993). The NaÐO(sulfonate) distances agree with the corresponding distance reported in the literature (Cai, Chen, Liao, Feng & Chen, 2001; Cai, Chen, Liao, Yao et al., 2001; Cai, Chen, Feng'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Figure 3 View of the packing diagram of (I), showing the dimeric arrangement in the bc plane.\\n\\net al., 2001) and are signi®cantly shorter than the NaÐ O(quinolinol) distance (Table 1).\\n\\nUnlike other sulfoxinates, the quinolinol O atom is not deprotonated, but is involved in a hydrogen bond with a symmetry-related O atom of the sulfonic acid group [O1Ð H1O3i; symmetry code: (i) 1 + x, y, z]. Atoms C4 and C6 are also involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding with atoms O4 and O2 of the sulfonate group (Table 2), forming ®vemembered rings on both sides of the SÐC bond. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding involving atom C6 with one of the sulfonate O atoms has also been observed in both 7-nitro-8hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid monohydrate (Balasubramanian & Muthiah, 1996b) and ferron (Balasubramanian & Muthiah, 1996a). There is also a glide-related CÐH interaction [HCg 2.6341 (6) AÊ and C2ÐH2Cg 134.02 (5); atom C2 is in the pyridine ring and Cg is the phenyl-ring centroid]. Stacking interactions between the pyridine and phenyl rings in adjacent complex units are observed. The centroid-to-centroid and interplanar distances are 3.499 (9) and 3.303 (4) AÊ , respectively.

The interest in these compounds is due to their intriguing structural topologies and potential application as microporous, magnetic, non-linear and ¯uorescent materials (Kahn et al., 2000; Yaghi et al., 1998; Batten & Robson 1998; Moulton & Zaworotko, 2001). In the construction of one-, two- and three-dimensional frameworks, multidentate ligands are usually used to bridge metal centres to form polymeric structures. Cadmium thiocyanate adducts of organic ligands are an important class of compounds for the design and preparation of functional coordination frameworks (Zhang et al., 1999). A number of cadmium(II) thiocyanate complex adducts of monodentate organic ligands, such as methyl-substituted pyridines (Taniguchi et al., 1986, 1987), dibenzylamine (Taniguchi & Ouchi 1987), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Chenskaya et al., 2000), 4-chloropyridine (Goher et al., 2003), 1H-1,2,4-triazole (Haasnoot et al., 1983) and imidazole (Chen et al., 1999), have been reported. All of these adducts exhibit chain structures, where each pair of adjacent CdII atoms are bridged by two inversely related -SCNÿ-N:S ligands and the remaining coordination sites are occupied by monodentate organic ligands. Few thiocyanatebridged cadmium(II) complexes consist of a two-dimensional network (Mondal et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2001).\\n\\nOur synthetic approach started by focusing on the\\n\\nconstruction of novel topological frameworks using ¯exible ligands such as 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethane (Li et al., Figure 1 A view of the local coordination of the CdII atom in (I), with displacement ellipsoids drawn at the 50% probability level. Only the atoms of the asymmetric unit have been labelled.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='2004), 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (Li et al., 2005) and 1,2-bis(benzotriazol-1-yl)ethane (Zhou et al., 2004). As a part of our work towards the rational design and preparation of functional coordination frameworks, we recently reported two novel thiocyanate cadmium complexes, namely [Cd- (NCS)2(bte)]n [bte is 1,2-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethane; Li et al., 2004] and [Cd1.5(NCS)3(bbta)1.5]n [bbta is 1,2-bis(benzotriazol-1-yl)ethane; Zhou et al., 2004]. In the present paper, we report the preparation and crystal structure of the novel title three-dimensional coordination polymer, [Cd(bbtz)- (NCS)2]n, (I), in which 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)- benzene (bbtz) ligands bridge a two-dimensional network containing 16-membered [Cd4(-SCN-N:S)4] rings.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='As shown in Fig. 1, the CdII atom of (I) lies on an inversion centre, in a distorted octahedral environment, coordinated by four N atoms from two symmetry-related thiocyanate ligands and bis-monodentate bbtz ligands in the equatorial positions, and two S atoms from two symmetry-related thiocyanate ligands in the axial positions. This coordination environment is similar to that in the chain structures of the cadmium(II) thiocyanate complex adducts of monodentate organic ligands, such as [Cd(NCS)2(L)2]n [L = 2-, 3- or 4-methylpyridine (Taniguchi et al., 1986, 1987), dibenzylamine (Taniguchi & Ouchi, 1987), 4-chloropyridine (Goher et al., 2003), 1H-1,2,4triazole (Haasnoot et al., 1983) and imidazole (Chen et al., 1999)], and that in the two-dimensional network cadmium thiocyanate complexes {[Cd(NCS)2(nicotinamide)2]H2O}n and [Cd(NCS)2(isonicotinamide)2]n (Yang et al., 2001). The NCSÿ anion acts as a bridging ligand in the -N:S mode in (I), with single thiocyanate bridges linking two CdII atoms to form the two-dimensional network. The -N:S coordination mode for the CdII atom is one of the usual coordination fashions (Zhang et al., 1999), since the CdII atom is in the centre of the hard±soft range in the acid±base concept.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='The CdÐNbbtz bond lengths (Table 1) are similar to those in other cadmium(II) bbtz complexes (Li et al., 2005), in [Cd(NCS)2(bte)]n (Li et al., 2004) and in [Cd(NCS)2(trz)2]n (trz = 1H-1,2,4-triazole; Haasnoot et al., 1983). The CdÐNNCS bond lengths (Table 1) are also similar to those in double thiocyanate-bridged cadmium(II) complexes, such as [Cd(NCS)2(L)2]n (L is a pyridine derivative, such as 2-, 3- or 4-methylpyridine and 4-chloropyridine; Taniguchi et al., 1986, 1987; Goher et al., 2003), [Cd(NCS)2(dibenzylamine)2]n (Taniguchi & Ouchi, 1987), [Cd(NCS)2(bte)]n (Li et al., 2004) and [Cd(NCS)2(trz)2] (Haasnoot et al., 1983), in the triple thiocyanate-bridged cadmium(II) complex [Cd1.5(bbta)1.5- (NCS)3]n (Zhou et al., 2004), and in singly thiocyanate-bridged cadmium(II) complexes, such as [Cd(NCS)2(dmen)]n (dmen = N,N-dimethylethylenediamine; Mondal et al., 2000), {[Cd- (NCS)2(nicotinamide)2]H2O}n and [Cd(NCS)2(isonicotinamide)2]n (Yang et al., 2001).\\n\\nThe CdÐSNCS bond lengths, and CdÐNÐCNCS and CdÐ SÐCSCN bond angles (Table 1), are similar to those in the above-cited thiocyanate-bridged cadmium(II) complexes. As illustrated in Fig. 2, each NCSÿ anion in (I) coordinates to two CdII atoms in a -N:S mode and single thiocyanate bridges link the CdII centres into a two-dimensional sheet, resulting in an hourglass-shaped 16-membered [Cd4(-NCS-N:S)4] metallacycle. Reports of such [Cd4(-NCS-N:S)4] metallacycle structures are rare. Two examples are [Cd(NCS)2(nicotinamide)2]H2O and [Cd(SCN)2(isonicotinamide)2] (Yang et al., 2001). The CdCd separation through the NCSÿ ligand is 6.2266 (7) AÊ , which is similar to the values of 6.231 (1) and 6.310 (1) AÊ in the singly thiocyanate-bridged cadmium(II) complexes {[Cd(NCS)2(nicotinamide)2]H2O}n and [Cd- (NCS)2(isonicotinamide)2]n (Yang et al., 2001).'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Because the methyl C atoms of the bbtz ligand can freely rotate to adjust to the coordination environment, bbtz can exhibit trans±gauche and gauche±gauche conformations.

To the best of our knowledge, construction of such a covalent three-dimensional network by bridging ligands and the [Cd(-NCS-N:S)2]n two-dimensional network are unprecedented in cadmium±thiocyanate systems. A 34-membered ring is formed through four CdII atoms linked by two single -N:S bridges and two bbtz ligands.

The structure comprises zigzag chains of alternating [Zn(H2O)2] 2+ and sulfonyldibenzoate units, the central Zn and S atoms of which lie on crystallographic twofold axes. The ZnII centre occupies a strongly distorted tetrahedral environment [OÐZnÐO = 83.30 (7)±136.19 (8)], coordinated by the two water O atoms [ZnÐO = 1.986 (2) AÊ ] and one O atom from each of two carboxylate groups [ZnÐO = 1.9942 (19) AÊ ], with much longer contacts to the other O atoms of these carboxylates [ZnÐO = 2.528 (2) AÊ ]. Hydrogen bonds between carboxylate O atoms and coordinated water molecules in adjacent chains lead to the formation of a threedimensional network structure.\\n\\nComment\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Comment\\n\\nIn recent years, much attention has been focused on the design and synthesis of supramolecular complexes because of their novel structural architectures and potential applications in catalysis, magnetism, ion exchange and nonlinear optics (Atwood et al., 1996; Barton et al., 1999; Lo et al., 2000). The basic strategy for the synthesis of such compounds involves connecting metal-containing building blocks with various multidentate ligands. As an important family of these multidentate ligands, organic aromatic polycarboxylate ligands such as benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate, benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate, 4,40-carbonylbis(benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate) and benzene1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylate have been extensively employed in the preparation of such metal±organic complexes. These products exhibit both high dimensionality in their structures and interesting properties (Chui et al., 1999; Li et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2004). Similarly, the 4,40-sulfonyldibenzoate anion (hereinafter DSDC) can act as a versatile ligand for the construction of novel metal±organic hybrid compounds, due to the presence of two carboxylate functions and its structural ¯exibility. However, to the best of our knowledge, no metal complexes with DSDC have been reported to date. Therefore,\\n\\nwith the aim of exploring the coordination chemistry of DSDC, the title complex, (I), was obtained from the hydrothermal reaction of dimethyl 4,40-sulfonyldibenzoate with zinc acetate and sodium hydroxide.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='As shown in Fig. 1, the Zn centres in (I) are four-coordinate in a highly distorted tetrahedral environment involving two O- atom donors of two DSDC ligands and two coordinated water molecules. The ZnII centre occupies a strongly distorted tetrahedral environment [OÐZnÐO = 83.30 (7)±136.19 (8)], coordinated by the two water O atoms [ZnÐO = 1.986 (2) AÊ ] and one O atom from each of two carboxylate groups [ZnÐO = 1.9942 (19) AÊ ], with much longer contacts to the other O atoms of these carboxylates [ZnÐO = 2.528 (2) AÊ ].\\n\\nThe bonded distances are in agreement with values reported in other zinc±carboxylate complexes (Monge et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006; He et al., 2006). The DSDC group acts as a bidentate ligand in this structure, with both carboxylate groups coordinating in an essentially monodentate manner to the ZnII centres.\\n\\nThe structure of (I) comprises zigzag chains of alternating [Zn(H2O)2] 2+ and sulfonyldibenzoate units, with their respective Zn and S atoms lying on crystallographic twofold axes. The zigzag nature of the chains, which run along the [101] direction (Fig. 2), can be traced to the O3ÐZn1ÐO3 and C1ÐS1ÐS1 angles of 99.67 (12) and 104.04 (17), respectively. The two benzene ring planes in the each DSDC ligand are almost perpendicular, with a dihedral angle of 80.99 (7), imparting a slight twist to the chains.

Abstract'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Preliminary Weissenberg photographs were used to check the quality of the chosen crystal and to determine the unit-cell dimensions. The structure was solved by direct methods using the SHELXTL-PIus program system (Sheldrick, 1990). All non- H atoms were located by difference synthesis. The refinement of the population parameters of the disordered water molecules was carded out by fixing the temperature factors at a reasonable value. In the final stages, the temperature factors were refined isotropically. Chemical analysis clearly indicates two water molecules in the formula unit. Omitting 023 and 026, both of which have an occupation factor of 0.1, leads to an increase of the R factor from 0.0541 to 0.0578 and AF then shows two maxima of 1.59 and 1.48 e ,~-3 close to O21 and 022. Refinement was by full-matrix least-squares methods. The weighting scheme shows no significant dependence on (sin0/A) and Fo/ Fo max.\\n\\nLists of structure factors, anisotropic displacement parameters and complete geometry have been deposited with the British Library Document Supply Centre as Supplementary Publication No. SUP 71743 (32 pp.).

Synthetic zeolites are frequently available only as polycrystalline powders and so powder diffraction is the common method of structure determination. Data collection using high-intensity radiation sources and very small single crystals has also been shown to be viable, and structures of aluminophosphates and other materials have been obtained (Cheetham, Harding, Haggitt, Mingos & Powell, 1993; Harding, Kariuki, Mathews, Smith & Braunstein, 1994; Cheetham, Harding, Rizkallah, Kau6i6 & Raji6 1991; Helliwell et al., 1993).\\n\\nThe asymmetric unit of the framework is composed of\\n\\none octahedrally coordinated A1 atom, two tetrahedrally coordinated A1 atoms and three tetrahedral P atoms. The octahedral A11 is coordinated to four O and two F atoms. The framework forms eight-ring channels parallel to the a, b and c axes and six-ring channels along [111], as depicted in Fig. 2. The figure also shows the F bridge between two symmetry-related AI atoms. The structuretype code is CHA (Meier & Olson, 1987), the same as\\n\\nFig. 1.

Bridging by F draws the A1 atoms closer together leading to distortion of the trigonal symmetry of chabazite. The template ions reside at the intersections of the six- and eightring channels. The template N atom is suitably located for hydrogen bonding with the framework [3.31 (5),4, from 02 and 2.82 (5) A from 09].\\n\\nThe morpholine molecules in the cages were also located in an independent synchrotron powder diffraction investigation of the material (Simmen, 1992).

Data were recorded on workstation 9.6 at the SRS, Daresbury, England. Crystal to detector distance was 40 mm and the detector angle (20) was -28 °. Frames of 0.2 ° were accumulated for 25-35 s at 2 GeV and 187 mA. A collimator of diameter 0.2 mm was used. The incident beam intensity was monitored continuously and intensity data were corrected for decrease with time. The images were processed offline by MADNES (Messerschmidt & Pflugrath, 1987) using a profile-fitting procedure characterized by EVAL = 6. Data collection, cell refinement and data reduction were performed using MADNES. After refinement of the framework, calculation of the difference map revealed the atoms of the template ion as distinct peaks. Assignment of the F site was based on chemical and geometrical grounds as well as spectroscopic evidence and confirmed by refinement of site occupancy. All atoms were refined isotropically with one temperature factor for Al and P, one for framework O and F and another for non-H template atoms (H-atom Utso was 1.2 times this value). In the last cycles of refinement, the template was refined as a rigid body. Program(s) used to solve structure: SHELXS86 (Sheldrick, 1985).

It crystallizes with DMF (Fu et al., 2005). With citric acid in place of formic acid, a similar synthesis affords cobalt(II) formate hydroxide, (I) (Fig. 1), the source of formic acid probably resulting from the decomposition of the citric acid. The compound adopts a three-dimensional network structure in which both the formate and hydroxide function in a 3-bridging mode; the CoII exists in a fac-octahedral arrangement; three of the O atoms belong to different formates and the other three to different hydroxides. The formate displays delocalized C—O bonds; one C—O bond is somewhat longer than the other. The O atom involved in the longer bond interacts with two Co atoms whereas the O atom involved in the shorter bond interacts with only one Co atom.\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nCrystal data [Co(CHO2)(OH)] Mo K radiation Mr = 120.96 Cell parameters from 1480 Trigonal, R3 reflections a = 11.698 (1) A˚ = 2.7–28.0 c = 11.661 (1) A˚ = 5.37 mm1 V = 1381.9 (2) A˚ 3 T = 295 (2) K Z = 18 Block, red Dx = 2.616 Mg m3 0.16  0.11  0.09 mm\\n\\nA mixture of cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (0.23 g, 0.5 mmol), citric acid (0.22 g, 1 mmol) and DMF (8 ml) was heated in a 15 ml Teflonlined steel bomb at 400 K for 50 d.

The role of zinc centers in these enzymes is to orientate and activate the substrates (Hegg & Burstyn, 1998; KraÈmer, 1999; Lipscomb & StraÈer, 1996). The preparation and development of new metallic model compounds to mimic the activity of nucleases\\n\\nin hydrolytic cleavage of DNA is an important and prosperous ®eld in bioinorganic chemistry. Previously, we reported a few binuclear metal complexes, including Ni2 (Meng et al., 2004) and Mg2 (Gao, Meng & Wei, 2004) complexes of Cl-HXTA (5-chloro-2-hydroxy-1,3-xylene-,-diamine-N,N,N0,N0-tetraacetic acid), which are able to scissor DNA hydrolytically. Cl-HXTA is an acyclic dinucleating ligand with a phenolate bridge (Murch et al., 1987). As a pentavalent anionic ligand, it has four methoxycarbonyl chelating arms with two sets of donor atoms, i.e. one N and three O atoms, as the coordination sites. One of the advantages of Cl-HXTA is that most of its dinuclear metal complexes are highly soluble in water.\\n\\nAs a continuation of the aforementioned study, we report here a newly synthesized binuclear zinc complex with CH3-HXTA (5-methyl-2-hydroxy-1,3-xylene-,-diamine-N,N,- N0,N0-tetraacetic acid), (I).

Fig. 1 shows that the coordination environments of the two oxobridged Zn ions are different in geometry and donor atoms, and differ from those in a related Zn complex (Gao, Meng & Zhu, 2004), where the two Zn atoms have similar coordination environments with distorted octahedral geometry. More speci®cally, atom Zn1 adopts a distorted octahedral coordination composed of two carboxylate groups, one tertiary N atom, two water molecules and the bridging phenolate ligand (atom O1), while atom Zn2 adopts a ®ve-coordinate pyramidal geometry composed of two carboxylate groups, one tertiary N atom from another coordination arm, one acetate anion as the counter-anion and the bridging phenolate ligand (O1). The Zn1Zn2 separation of 3.630 (4) AÊ , which is shorter than the value of 3.745 (3) AÊ reported by Gao, Meng & Zhu (2004), suggests no obvious metal±metal bond formation. The Zn1ÐO1 distance is 2.036 (4) AÊ , while the Zn2ÐO1 distance is 1.990 (4) AÊ , indicating that the bridging O atom is similar but not equivalent for both Zn1 and Zn2. The Zn1Ð O1ÐZn2 angle is 128.74 (19), which is less than that found by Gao, Meng & Zhu (2004) [131.7 (3)].

The least-squares plane of the benzene ring of CH3-HXTA and the Zn1/O1/Zn2 plane are twisted with a dihedral angle of 52.75 (4). Zn3 and Zn4 atoms lie on inversion centres and join binuclear complex units containing Zn1 and Zn2 through carboxylate O atoms of the CH3-HXTA ligand into an in®nite chain (Fig. 2). Zn3 and Zn4 have equal octahedral environments consisting of four O atoms from four water molecules and two acetate carbonyl O atoms from the CH3-HXTA ligand.

Along the chain, neighboring aromatic rings are distributed alternately above and below the chain. This chain extends in®nitely with a repeat unit (e.g. Zn3AZn3B) of 29.0 (4) AÊ (Fig. 2). Between the coordination chains, the shortest ZnZn separations are 5.750 (4) and 6.806 (4) AÊ . The whole structure is stabilized by a hydrogen-bond net, which is formed mainly by solvent water molecules, as shown in Fig. 2.

Among the organic tetrazolates, the crystal structure is known only for dimethylammonium 5-phenyltetrazolate (Guzei & Bikzhanova, 2002). The 5-phenyltetrazolate anion is monodentate in the titanium and niobium (Yelamos et al., 2001) complexes. In the potassium derivative, it binds as a bidentate chelate (Zheng et al., 2003), whereas in the copper derivative it functions as a bridging ligand (Shao et al., 2004). The dicyclopentadienyllanthanum derivative has the ligand binding in a bridging mode (Zhou et al., 2000); other lanthanide complexes show similar bonding features (Zhou et al., 1998). On the other hand, the diphenylthallium derivative has a complex composition (Bhandari et al., 2000), as does the dicyclopentadienylholonium derivative (Huang et al., 1998). The zinc derivative is known to be SHG-active (Ye et al., 2005); the only other inorganic main-group compound appears to be the aluminium derivative (Munoz-Hernandez et al., 1998).\\n\\nSilver 5-phenyltetrazolate, (I), was first mentioned in the\\n\\ncontext of the photolysis of 2-alkenyl-5-phenyl-substituted tetrazoles (Padwa et al., 1978). In (I), the anion uses three of its four Lewis basic sites to bind to three different Ag atoms; the metal atom shows a trigonal planar coordination (Fig. 1 # 2006 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved and Table 1). The binding mode gives rise to the formation of a ribbon motif; the backbone of the ribbon, which propagates along the b axis, is essentially flat.\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nSilver perchlorate (41 mg, 0.2 mmol) and 5-phenyltetrazole (30 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in 10% aqueous ammonia (10 ml).

In order to study the reaction behavior of metal oxides, organoamine ligands were often selected for the construction of inorganic±organic hybrid materials. Organoamines act in three different roles in these inorganic±organic hybrid materials (Hagrman et al., 1999): (i) as charge-compensating cations, (ii) directly bonded to the metal site of the metal oxide skeleton backbone and (iii) bonded to the heterometal atom. Recently, Zubieta and coworkers chose organoamines as a ligand and reported several molybdenum oxide hybrid compounds, such as MoO3(2,20bpy), Mo2O6(2,20-bpy), Mo3O9(2,20-bpy)2, Mo4O13(Hbpa), (H2en)Mo3O10 and [H3N(CH2)6NH3][Mo4O13] with a onedimensional chain structure (Kahn & Zubieta, 1993; Zapf et al., 1997a,b, 1998; Xu et al., 1996); compounds with a twodimensional structure [4,40-H2bpy][Mo7O22].H2O (Zapf et al., 1997a,b) and MO3(py) (M = Mo,W) (Johnson et al., 1981) and a three-dimensional network structure HMo2O6(4,40-bpy).\\n\\nHerein we report the crystal structure of a molybdenum trioxide±pyrazine complex possessing a three-dimensional framework structure prepared via hydrothermal reaction, i.e. Mo2O6(pz).\\n\\nReceived 20 February 2001 Accepted 12 March 2001 Online 23 March 2001 # 2001 International Union of Crystallography\\n\\nPrinted in Great Britain ± all rights reserved\\n\\n[Mo2O6(C4H4N2)] Mr = 367.98 Orthorhombic, Pbca a = 7.566 (16) AÊ b = 7.39 (2) AÊ c = 14.04 (3) AÊ\\n\\ndecarboxylated reaction of the pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid.\\n\\nEvery MoVI atom is coordinated by ®ve O atoms and one pyrazine N atom to form an [MoO5N] octahedral geometry.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='decarboxylated reaction of the pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid.\\n\\nEvery MoVI atom is coordinated by ®ve O atoms and one pyrazine N atom to form an [MoO5N] octahedral geometry.\\n\\nThe MoÐO bond lengths range from 1.682 (7) to 2.086 (8) AÊ and the MoÐN distance is 2.449 (8) AÊ .
