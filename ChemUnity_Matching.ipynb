      "[Yb2IJBDC)3IJDMF)2]·H2O (1) crystallises from a DMF-rich solvent and we previously reported its synthesis and structure in a preliminary communication.17 The material contains a single crystallographic ytterbium coordinated to seven oxygens: six from singly coordinating 1,4-benzenedicarboxylates and one from an O-coordinated DMF, Fig. 1a. The coordinated DMF is structurally disordered across two positions in a ratio of 0.6 : 0.4. Each ytterbium is connected to adjacent ytterbiums via either two or four carboxylato groups from the BDC linkers in a regular (–Yb–(O–C–O)4–Yb–(O–C–O)2–) fashion (Z,Z-μ2-η1:η1 using the notation of Batten et al.29). This leads to the formation of 1-D chains of ytterbium-carboxylate chains running along the c-axis, Fig. 1a. The coordinated DMF molecules orientate perpendicular to the dimension of the chains. Every ytterbium-carboxylate chain is connected to four other chains through the BDC linkers. The linkers originating from (Yb–(O–C–O)4–Yb) dimers connect only to (Yb–(O–C–O)2–Yb) dimers and vice versa. This leads to directly\n",

Fig. 2c), (c) overall view of the structure showing the two interpenetrated three-dimensional networks in red and green.

Terminal oxygens are those of water molecules and occluded DMF is not shown. connected chains being out of phase with one another. The periodicity of chains is restored with the next level of connectivity: chains that are adjacent with regards to the b-axis are able to stack well each other, resulting in regular packing of coordinated DMF along the c-axis. The overall effect of the interconnectivity of the ytterbium-carboxylate chains leads to the formation of diamond shaped 1-D channels running along the c-axis, occupied by coordinated DMF and extraframework water, Fig. 1b. Since all metal atoms are connected by organic moieties, the structure can be described as (I0O3) using the Cheetham–Rao–Feller nomenclature.30 The topology of (1) is assigned as sra (the Al net in SrAl2, see ESI†), a commonly observed topology for materials\n",

The presence of water, in addition to the small radius of Yb3+ compared to Er3+, has the effect of decreasing the Yb–Yb–Yb angle (148°) leading to a greater 'corrugation' of the ytterbium-carboxylate chains along the c-axis as opposed to the more flattened chains of the erbium material (157°). Despite the lack of occluded water, the erbium material has a larger unit cell volume at room temperature (3524.0IJ12) Å3), consistent with the larger ionic radius of erbium when compared with ytterbium.\n",

      "This is also reflected in the larger average Ln–O bond distances (Yb–O = 2.268 Å, Er–O = 2.284 Å).

Each ytterbium is coordinated to four oxygens from two bis-coordinating carboxylato groups (η2), two oxygens from singly coordinated carboxylato groups and one oxygen each from both a coordinated DMF molecule and a water molecule, leading to a coordination number of 8. Each ytterbium exists as part of a dimer, linked to another ytterbium by bridging carboxylato groups in which each oxygen in each carboxylate is linked to a different Yb (Z,Z-μ2-η1:η1),\n",

      "Fig. 2a. Each BDC coordinates in the same manner at both of its carboxylate groups i.e. each BDC only coordinates as either n2 or Z,Z-U2-n2:n1 exclusively. Each dimer is linked to six other dimers: four by each bis-coordinating linker and two by the bridging BDCs. This interconnectivity leads to the overall structure of (2), Fig. 2b, with connectivity I'O3 in the Cheetham-Rao-Feller nomenclature. The coordinated DMF molecules project into a void with a closest interatomic distance between neighbouring DMF molecules of 6.98 Å (N-N distance). The overall structure of (2) shows a 2-fold interpenetrated peu topology, in which each net can be considered as the a-Po type where the centres of the binuclear lanthanide clusters are the nodes, and no accessible pore space is available. An erbium analogue of (2) has been previously reported by Chen et al.,35 although in the previous work the composition Er2(BDC)3(DMF)2(H2O)2-H2O was found, i.e. with additional crystal water occluded within the structure.\n",

      "Extending the reaction time used to prepare (2) yields an anhydrous mixed 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate-formate, Yb(BDC)- (HCO2), (3), which is isostructural with a known gadolinium analogue.36 The formate anion bridges three neighbouring Yb centres in u2-n2:n2 mode while the BDC linker links via a Z,Z-u2-n1:n4. This results in a single crystallographic Yb with coordination number eight, with two oxygens from a common formate, two from two further formates and four from four distinct BDC linkers. Each Yb is connected to three others by bridging oxygen atoms from these connecting ligands, Fig. 3a. Alternatively the structure may be viewed as dimeric Yb2 clusters formed through edge-sharing of adjacent polyhedra, further linked by sharing corners to give a 1D sheet, Fig. 3b.

However, we can measure the induction time for the onset of crystallisation for all temperatures by inspection of the crystallisation data and this shows a significant retardation of crystallisation as the reaction temperature is lowered, as shown in Table 1. The Gualtieri model requires knowledge of the crystal morphology since the dimensionality of crystal growth (n) is a variable in the model and for (2) SEM was used to inspect the crystal morphology of a typical sample: this showed irregular-shaped crystallites of a few microns in size, but no obvious anisotropy (ESI†), hence n was set at 3.\n",

The fitted kinetic parameters allow a probability of nucleation function to be determined, also shown on Fig. 8, and this reveals that nucleation continues late into the crystallisation, which is further supported by the observation in SEM of a variety of crystallite sizes, notably submicron crystallites on the surface of larger particles. This situation can be contrasted with the case of (1) where needleshaped crystals of several hundred microns were found, consistent with a short period of nucleation and extended onedimensional crystal growth found by the Gualtieri fit to the crystallisation data.13 Inspection of the rate constants is also informative: for (2) the rate constant for crystal growth is similar for that of nucleation and much larger than for (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests a rather different crystal growth mechanism for the two materials, which is not surprising given their very different structures with the open-framework one-dimensional channels of (1) contrasting with the interpenetrated networks of (2).\n",
      "\n",
      "We previously reported how during the synthesis of (1) the cell parameters showed a continuous evolution during the growth of the material, which could be explained by the partial replacement of initially coordinated water by solvent DMF, as proven by Rietveld analysis of the in situ diffraction data. The crystallisation of (2) shows similar behaviour, Fig. 9, with all six triclinic lattice parameters evolving with crystallisation time, as determined by Pawley fitting of the in situ patterns. It should be noted that constant reaction temperature is reached before crystallisation of (2) starts so the shift in unit cell parameters is not a thermal effect. It is noteworthy that as crystallisation reaches completion beyond 100 minutes the change in lattice parameter slows, which also verifies that the earlier shift in Bragg peak positions is a real effect and not an experimental artefact. Since (2) contains coordinated DMF and crystal water, it is probable that the evolution of lattice parameter is due to changing amount of occluded solvent as the crystals are formed, as was the case for (1); however, for (2) the lower symmetry triclinic unit cell meant that further interpretation of the data (such as Rietveld refinement to refine fractional occupancy of solvent molecules) proved impossible.\n",

      "Despite the variety of lanthanide organic frameworks already reported in the literature, exploration of ytterbium chemistry with commercially available dicarboxylic acids yields a set of materials with diverse structures, including an isoreticular pair of open-framework materials and a pillared layered structure in which formate is included from hydrolysis of DMF with extended reaction time. While the phases are related to known materials reported separately for other lanthanides, the ytterbium 1,4benzenedicarboxylate materials we describe are formed from a single set of reagents by varying solvent composition and/ or time of crystallisation. The crystallisation kinetics of two of these materials can be modelled using the Gualtieri nucleation growth model, providing new crystal growth kinetic parameters much needed to put MOF formation on a firmer foundation, while the high resolution of the in situ X-ray patterns means that subtle structural changes can be detected during crystallisation under realistic laboratory conditions, providing evidence for the evolution of MOF structure during crystallisation.\n",

Serra,b Dermot O'Hare c and Richard I. Walton *a The ytterbium 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) framework [Yb2IJBDC)3IJDMF)2]·H2O (1) crystallises from a N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF)-rich solution at 80–120 °C. (1) is constructed from infinite chains of dicarboxylate-bridged seven-coordinate Yb atoms, cross-linked in two directions by BDC to yield diamond-shaped channels (sra topology) lined by coordinated DMF molecules and occluded water. Increasing the water content in the synthesis solution yields a material with more crystal water Yb2IJBDC)3IJDMF)2IJH2O)2 (2), in which the Yb centres are eight-coordinate and form dimers bridged by BDC to give two interpenetrating networks of pcu (α-Po) topology. Upon extended reaction in this water-rich solvent mixture, an alternative phase is formed: an anhydrous mixed BDC-formate, YbIJBDC)IJHCO2), (3), which has a pillared, layered structure, with formate produced by hydrolysis of the DMF. An isoreticular version of (2) can also be formed under similar conditions using 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylate (NDC) as linker: [Yb2IJNDC)3IJH2O)4]·2DMF (4). Despite their different structures, (1) and (2) are calcined to a common porous, desolvated phase Yb2IJBDC)3 at 300 °C. Using high energy X-rays at Diamond Light Source we are able to penetrate the solvothermal reaction vessels and to follow the formation of (1) and (2) in real time. This allows accurate crystallisation curves to be obtained from which qualitative kinetic information is extracted. Importantly, the high angular resolution of the in situ powder XRD patterns allows refinement of crystal structure: this permits the temporal evolution of unit cell parameters to be followed, which are ascribed to changes in coordinated solvent composition within the materials during their formation, while analysis of phase fraction allows kinetic parameters to be quantified using the nucleation-growth model of Gualtieri.\n",

      "these materials lies both in their structural chemistry, which can be distinctly different from that of transition-metal carboxylates due to the preference for higher coordination numbers of the lanthanide ions, and the possibility of interesting physical properties for use in a variety of applications. The f-block metal cations have well-known characteristics from classical coordination chemistry, including photoluminescence, Lewis acidity, and unusual magnetism arising from single-ion anisotropy and slow relaxation effects. Introducing such properties into extended metal–organic framework (MOF) structures may then allow the development of new functional materials. Luminescence may be enhanced by the connecting linkers and self-quenching effect minimised by separation of the lanthanide centres with extended ligands,2 while porous systems can be developed where the addition of a guest molecule gives a tuneable optical response.3 For example, sensing of explosives such as nitrobenzene derivatives has proved possible.4 Other light emission properties have been tuned to produce 'MOF barcodes', where mixtures\n",

      "of different lanthanides in a common structure yield a unique spectroscopic signature5 and the formation of a light emitting thermometer based on the thermally varying luminescence from a mixed Eu–Tb framework constructed from the linker 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate.6 Early work on catalysis by lanthanide MOFs studied Lewis acidity and redox activity for reactions such as acetalization of aldehydes and oxidation of sulphides,7 cyanosilylation8 and in bifunctional oxidation catalysts.9 In more recent work in catalysis with lanthanide MOFs some examples of shape-selectivity are emerging when basic ligands are used.10 For example, some have been developed as water-resistant and recyclable solid Lewisacids for various organic reactions,11 while recently a multifunctional MOF based on a flexible dicarboxylate ligand and various lanthanides was produced with Lewis acidity and as a support for palladium for organic reductions.12 Despite the large number of studies on the crystallisation of lanthanide MOFs, the number of new framework materials reported in the literature continues to grow. Although increasingly elaborate, custom-made ligands are employed to design new frameworks, it is often the case that new materials may be simply formed from a given set of metals and ligands; this is because the MOF that crystallises from a particular reagent mixture may not be the only material that forms under those conditions, with subtle changes in temperature, time, solvent compositions having an influence over the resulting product. For example, in the case of lanthanum combined with the ligand 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bisIJbenzoic acid), three different MOFs polymorphs were found, with the most commonly seen computed to be a metastable phase,13 highlighting how fine control of synthesis conditions is needed in order to isolate a desired material. Further, for lanthanide materials, the decrease in ionic radius across the lanthanide series mean that variety of structures can form depending on the lanthanide chosen (or the mixture of lanthanides in mixed-metal systems). It thus remains difficult to predict the outcome of the crystallisation of metal–organic frameworks from a given set of reagents.14 One approach to this problem is a systematic exploration of reagents and reaction conditions, which, although time-consuming, may provide high-quality specimens for structural analysis. Another distinct approach is to use in situ studies of crystallisation to allow the kinetics and mechanism of MOF crystal growth to be quantified, putting the understanding of crystallisation on a firmer fundamental footing.15 In this paper we report a study that combines these two approaches to the formation of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylates of ytterbium, combining one of the lanthanides with the smallest ionic radius with one of the dicarboxylate ligands most widely used in MOF chemistry. Although various ytterbium 1-4,benzenedicarboxylates have already been reported in the literature,16 and we have recently described the crystallisation of a further example,17 herein we report two new phases, along with an isoreticular version of one of these, and describe a study of crystallisation kinetics of two using a recently developed approach with high energy X-rays.17–19\n",

      "hydrolysis of DMF in the water-rich solvent with prolonged reaction time, as it is well known that decomposition of DMF occurs in water to give formic acid and dimethylamine.37 This effect has been noted before in the synthesis of other MOFs,38 and a similar situation was reported in the formation of the gadolinium analogue of (3), although in that work HCl was used in the synthesis.36 Replacement of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid by 2,6naphthalene-dicarboxylic acid in the DMF-rich solvent yields [Yb2IJNDC)3IJH2O)4]·2DMF (4), a material that has an isoreticular structure to (2). In this case the directly coordinated solvent molecules are only water and the DMF present in the structure fills void space, with evidence for a hydrogen bond between it and the Yb-coordinated water molecule (O–O distance of 2.58 Å), but the ytterbium coordination number, and the geometry and connectivity of the framework is the same as in (2), Fig. 4a. The extended 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylate linker gives a more open network, Fig. 4b, but the overall structure shows the same doubly interpenetrated network as in (2), Fig. 4c. The powder XRD pattern of the bulk sample of (4) shows fair agreement with the pattern simulated from the single crystal structure (ESI†), although the elemental analysis shows excess nitrogen suggesting some impurity may be present and so no further analysis of this phase was performed.\n",

Note that in the decay of H2BDC the green line is a guide for the eye and the discontinuity at 15–20 minutes is an experiment artefact, likely due to fluctuation of material in the beam. der XRD shows that the Yb2IJBDC)3 material is the same in both cases, Fig. 6a, but its powder diffraction pattern shows considerable peak broadening suggesting loss of crystal integrity upon solvent loss so that its structure remain unsolved and we are only able to assign a tentative unit cell based on indexing.17 A search of the literature for other anhydrous rare-earth 1,4-benzenedicarboxyltes Ln2IJBDC)3 produced no matches to our powder diffraction data. Since (1) and (2) have structures of different connectivities and topologies the conversion of at least one of these materials to Yb2IJBDC)3 must occur with bond breaking and forming, which may also go towards explaining the poorly crystalline nature of this phase. We can speculate that thermodiffractometry data would imply that it is (2) that undergoes most structural rearrangement to give the anhydrous Yb2IJBDC)3 product since the Bragg peaks of the resulting phase are broader in this case (Fig. 5): this would also be consistent with the collapse of the interpenetrated network of (2) requiring greater atomic displacements. Interestingly, Yb2IJBDC)3 shows porosity, Fig. 6b, as evidenced by nitrogen adsorption isotherms, which give a BET surface area of 305 m2 g−1 and 376 m2 g−1 for the samples prepared by calcination of (1) and (2), respectively. The higher surface area of the latter may be due to a more defective structure following structural rearrangement.\n",

      "The kinetics of crystallisation (2) were studied using in situ, time-resolved diffraction to compare with the previous results we recently obtained from a similar study of (1).17 The in situ diffraction data measured during the formation of (2) shows the consumption of the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid during the early stages of reaction, Fig. 7a, which is apparent owing to the low solubility of the precursor in the water-rich solvent mixture. The shift of the Bragg peaks of the 1,4benzenedicarboxylic acid at the early stages of the reaction is because the reaction is still being heated at this point (see Fig. 8). Full pattern fitting, Fig. 7b–d, confirms the identity of phases present at each stage.\n",

      "Analysis of the kinetics of crystallisation is possible from the temporal evolution of the phase fractional of material as obtained from the full pattern fitting, Fig. 8. This analysis firstly shows how most of the 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid is consumed before the onset of crystallisation of the product, presumably due to its dissolution. We have used the kinetic model of Gualtieri39 to determine kinetic parameters that describe the crystallisation (see ESI†). This model has the advantage of parameterising nucleation and crystal growth as two separate events and was developed for the hydrothermal formation of zeolites and subsequently used by a number of groups for study of the solvothermal crystallisation of MOFs.17,19,40 Although we studied the crystallisation of (2) at four different temperatures (90, 100, 110 and 120 °C), owing to the limited amount of beamtime available, only at the higher two temperatures did the reactions reach completion.\n",
